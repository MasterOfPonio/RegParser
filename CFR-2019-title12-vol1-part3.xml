      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 3.1</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, reservations of authority, and timing.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for national banks or Federal savings associations. This part includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation of authority.</E> Nothing in this part shall be read to limit the authority of the OCC to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards.</E> Each national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory capital.</E> Each national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets.</E> (i) Each national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk national bank or Federal savings association) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(ii) Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of this part for a market risk national bank or Federal savings association) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Disclosures.</E> (i) Except for an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.</P>
        <P>(ii) Each market risk national bank or Federal savings association must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(iii) Each advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must make the public disclosures described in subpart E of this part.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Reservation of authority</E>—(1) <E T="03">Additional capital in the aggregate.</E> The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to hold an amount <PRTPAGE P="18"/>of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's credit, market, operational, or other risks.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory capital elements.</E> (i) If the OCC determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments set forth in subpart C of this part, the OCC may find that a capital element may be included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with § 3.20(e).</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-weighted asset amounts.</E> If the OCC determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the national bank or Federal savings association for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Total leverage.</E> If the OCC determines that the total leverage exposure, or the amount reflected in the national bank's or Federal savings association's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by a national bank or Federal savings association under § 3.10 is inappropriate for the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Consolidation of certain exposures.</E> The OCC may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the national bank or Federal savings association to the entity. Upon making this determination, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the national bank or Federal savings association for purposes of determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The OCC will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the OCC deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Other reservation of authority.</E> With respect to any deduction or limitation required under this part, the OCC may require a different deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice and response procedures.</E> In making a determination under this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner as the notice and response procedures in § 3.404.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (1) Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of this part, an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that is not a savings and loan holding company must:</P>

        <P>(B) The PFE for each derivative contract or each single-product netting set of derivative contracts (including a cleared transaction except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(I) of this section and, at the discretion of the national <PRTPAGE P="43"/>bank or Federal savings association, excluding a forward agreement treated as a derivative contract that is part of a repurchase or reverse repurchase or a securities borrowing or lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP), to which the national bank or Federal savings association is a counterparty as determined under § 3.34, but without regard to § 3.34(b), provided that:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A national bank or Federal savings association may choose to exclude the PFE of all credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection when calculating the PFE under § 3.34, but without regard to § 3.34(b), provided that it does not adjust the net-to-gross ratio (NGR); and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A national bank or Federal savings association that chooses to exclude the PFE of credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section must do so consistently over time for the calculation of the PFE for all such instruments;</P>
        <P>(C) The amount of cash collateral that is received from a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has offset the mark-to-fair value of the derivative asset, or cash collateral that is posted to a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has reduced the national bank's or Federal savings association's on-balance sheet assets, unless such cash collateral is all or part of variation margin that satisfies the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For derivative contracts that are not cleared through a QCCP, the cash collateral received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated (by law, regulation or an agreement with the counterparty);</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Variation margin is calculated and transferred on a daily basis based on the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The variation margin transferred under the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction is the full amount that is necessary to fully extinguish the net current credit exposure to the counterparty of the derivative contracts, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty under the terms of the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The variation margin is in the form of cash in the same currency as the currency of settlement set forth in the derivative contract, provided that for the purposes of this paragraph, currency of settlement means any currency for settlement specified in the governing qualifying master netting agreement and the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement, or in the governing rules for a cleared transaction;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The derivative contract and the variation margin are governed by a qualifying master netting agreement between the legal entities that are the counterparties to the derivative contract or by the governing rules for a cleared transaction, and the qualifying master netting agreement or the governing rules for a cleared transaction must explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to settle any payment obligations on a net basis, taking into account any variation margin received or provided under the contract if a credit event involving either counterparty occurs;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The variation margin is used to reduce the current credit exposure of the derivative contract, calculated as described in § 3.34(a), and not the PFE; and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) For the purpose of the calculation of the NGR described in § 3.34(a)(2)(ii)(B), variation margin described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">6</E>) of this section may not reduce the net current credit exposure or the gross current credit exposure;</P>
        <P>(D) The effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the derivative contract) of a credit derivative, or other similar instrument, through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, provided that:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the amount of any reduction in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative if the reduction is <PRTPAGE P="44"/>recognized in common equity tier 1 capital;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative or other similar instrument, provided that the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection and that:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references a single exposure, the reference exposure of the purchased credit derivative is to the same legal entity and ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is junior to, the reference exposure of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection; or</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references multiple exposures, the reference exposures of the purchased credit derivative are to the same legal entities and rank <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the reference exposures of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, and the level of seniority of the purchased credit derivative ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> to the level of seniority of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Where a national bank or Federal savings association has reduced the effective notional amount of a credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must also reduce the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative used to offset the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection, by the amount of any increase in the mark-to-fair value of the purchased credit derivative that is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital; and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Where the national bank or Federal savings association purchases credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on a credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in net income, but does not record offsetting deterioration in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection in net income (either through reductions in fair value or by additions to reserves), the national bank or Federal savings association may not use the purchased credit protection to offset the effective notional principal amount of the related credit derivative through which the national bank or Federal savings association provides credit protection;</P>

        <P>(E) Where a national bank or Federal savings association acting as a principal has more than one repo-style transaction with the same counterparty and has offset the gross value of receivables due from a counterparty under reverse repurchase transactions by the gross value of payables under repurchase transactions due to the same counterparty, the gross value of receivables associated with the repo-style transactions <E T="03">less</E> any on-balance sheet receivables amount associated with these repo-style transactions included under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, unless the following criteria are met:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The offsetting transactions have the same explicit final settlement date under their governing agreements;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The right to offset the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding; and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Under the governing agreements, the counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or settle according to a process that is the functional equivalent of net settlement, (that is, the cash flows of the transactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on the settlement date), where both transactions are settled through <PRTPAGE P="45"/>the same settlement system, the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both transactions will occur by the end of the business day, and the settlement of the underlying securities does not interfere with the net cash settlement;</P>
        <P>(F) The counterparty credit risk of a repo-style transaction, including where the national bank or Federal savings association acts as an agent for a repo-style transaction and indemnifies the customer with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty in an amount limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, calculated as follows:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the transaction is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) for transactions with a counterparty must be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis, such that each transaction <E T="03">i</E> is treated as its own netting set, in accordance with the following formula, where E<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or provided as collateral to the counterparty, and C<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or received as collateral from the counterparty:
        </P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">E<E T="52">i</E>* = max {0, [E<E T="52">i</E> − C<E T="52">i</E>]}; and</FP>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the transaction is subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) must be calculated as the greater of zero and the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase or provided as collateral to a counterparty for all transactions included in the qualifying master netting agreement (ΣE<E T="52">i</E>), <E T="03">less</E> the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the national bank or Federal savings association borrowed, purchased subject to resale or received as collateral from the counterparty for those transactions (ΣC<E T="52">i</E>), in accordance with the following formula:</P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">E* = max {0, [ΣE<E T="52">i</E> − ΣC<E T="52">i</E>]}</FP>
        <P>(G) If a national bank or Federal savings association acting as an agent for a repo-style transaction provides a guarantee to a customer of the security or cash its customer has lent or borrowed with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty and the guarantee is not limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, the amount of the guarantee that is greater than the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has provided;</P>
        <P>(H) The credit equivalent amount of all off-balance sheet exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association, excluding repo-style transactions, repurchase or reverse repurchase or securities borrowing or lending transactions that qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP, and derivative transactions, determined using the applicable credit conversation factor under § 3.33(b), provided, however, that the minimum credit conversion factor that may be assigned to an off-balance sheet exposure under this paragraph is 10 percent; and</P>
        <P>(I) For a national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that guarantees the performance of a clearing member client with respect to a cleared transaction must treat its exposure to the clearing member client as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that guarantees the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client must treat its exposure to the CCP as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A clearing member national bank or Federal savings association that does not guarantee the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client may exclude its exposure to the <PRTPAGE P="46"/>CCP for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A national bank or Federal savings association that is a clearing member may exclude from its total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit protection sold through a credit derivative contract, or other similar instrument, that it clears on behalf of a clearing member client through a CCP as calculated in accordance with part (c)(4)(ii)(D); and</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(I)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may exclude from its total leverage exposure a clearing member's exposure to a clearing member client for a derivative contract, if the clearing member client and the clearing member are affiliates and consolidated for financial reporting purposes on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Federal savings association tangible capital ratio.</E> A Federal savings association's tangible capital ratio is the ratio of the Federal savings association's core capital (tier 1 capital) to average total assets as calculated under this subpart B. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), the term “total assets” means “total assets” as defined in part 6, subpart A of this chapter, subject to subpart G of this part.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Capital adequacy.</E> (1) Notwithstanding the minimum requirements in this part, a national bank or Federal savings association must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which the national bank or Federal savings association is exposed. The supervisory evaluation of a national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy is based on an individual assessment of numerous factors, including those listed at this section (national banks), 12 CFR 167.3(c) (Federal savings associations).</P>
        <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.</P>

The maximum payout ratio is based on the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, as set forth in Table 1 to § 3.11.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Maximum payout amount.</E> A national bank's or Federal savings association's maximum payout amount for the current calendar quarter is equal to the national bank's or Federal savings association's eligible retained income, multiplied by the applicable maximum payout ratio, as set forth in Table 1 to § 3.11.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Private sector credit exposure.</E> Private sector credit exposure means an exposure to a company or an individual that is not an exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, a MDB, a PSE, or a GSE.<PRTPAGE P="47"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Calculation of capital conservation buffer.</E> (i) A national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer is equal to the lowest of the following ratios, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter based on the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent Call Report:</P>
        <P>(A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1 capital ratio minus the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 3.10;</P>
        <P>(B) The national bank's or Federal savings association's tier 1 capital ratio minus the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 3.10; and</P>
        <P>(C) The national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital ratio minus the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum total capital ratio requirement under § 3.10; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A)-(C) of this section, if the national bank's or Federal savings association's common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio is less than or equal to the national bank's or Federal savings association's minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio requirement under § 3.10, respectively, the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital conservation buffer is zero.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Limits on distributions and discretionary bonus payments.</E> (i) A national bank or Federal savings association shall not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments or create an obligation to make such distributions or payments during the current calendar quarter that, in the aggregate, exceed the maximum payout amount.</P>
        <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association with a capital conservation buffer that is greater than 2.5 percent plus 100 percent of its applicable countercyclical capital buffer, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, is not subject to a maximum payout amount under this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Negative eligible retained income.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter if the national bank's or Federal savings association's:</P>
        <P>(A) Eligible retained income is negative; and</P>
        <P>(B) Capital conservation buffer was less than 2.5 percent as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Prior approval.</E> Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, the OCC may permit a national bank or Federal savings association to make a distribution or discretionary bonus payment upon a request of the national bank or Federal savings association, if the OCC determines that the distribution or discretionary bonus payment would not be contrary to the purposes of this section, or to the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association. In making such a determination, the OCC will consider the nature and extent of the request and the particular circumstances giving rise to the request.</P>

        <P>(b) <E T="03">Countercyclical capital buffer amount</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a countercyclical capital buffer amount in accordance with the following paragraphs for purposes of determining its maximum payout ratio under Table 1 to § 3.11.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Extension of capital conservation buffer.</E> The countercyclical capital buffer amount is an extension of the capital conservation buffer as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amount.</E> An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association has a countercyclical capital buffer amount determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer amounts established for the national jurisdictions where the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures are located, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Weighting.</E> The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the national bank's or Federal savings association's private sector credit exposures. The methodology a national bank or Federal savings association uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under § 3.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under § 3.210 multiplied by 12.5.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Location.</E> (A) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the location of a private sector credit exposure is the national jurisdiction where the borrower is located (that is, where it is incorporated, chartered, or similarly established or, if the borrower is an individual, where the borrower resides).</P>
        <P>(B) If, in accordance with subparts D or E of this part, the national bank or Federal savings association has assigned to a private sector credit exposure a risk weight associated with a protection provider on a guarantee or credit derivative, the location of the exposure is the national jurisdiction where the protection provider is located.</P>
        <P>(C) The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying exposures, or, if the underlying exposures are located in more than one national jurisdiction, the national jurisdiction where the underlying exposures with the largest aggregate unpaid principal balance are located. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the location of an underlying exposure shall be the location of the borrower, determined consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Countercyclical capital buffer amount for credit exposures in the United States</E>—(i) <E T="03">Initial countercyclical capital buffer amount with respect to credit exposures in the United States.</E> The initial countercyclical capital buffer amount in the United States is zero.<PRTPAGE P="49"/>
        </P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>10</SU> The OCC expects that any adjustment will be based on a determination made jointly by the Board, OCC, and FDIC.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Range of countercyclical capital buffer amount.</E> The OCC will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for credit exposures in the United States between zero percent and 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Adjustment determination.</E> The OCC will base its decision to adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount under this section on a range of macroeconomic, financial, and supervisory information indicating an increase in systemic risk including, but not limited to, the ratio of credit to gross domestic product, a variety of asset prices, other factors indicative of relative credit and liquidity expansion or contraction, funding spreads, credit condition surveys, indices based on credit default swap spreads, options implied volatility, and measures of systemic risk.</P>
        <P>(v) <E T="03">Effective date of adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount</E>—(A) <E T="03">Increase adjustment.</E> A determination by the OCC under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to increase the countercyclical capital buffer amount will be effective 12 months from the date of announcement, unless the OCC establishes an earlier effective date and includes a statement articulating the reasons for the earlier effective date.</P>
        <P>(B) <E T="03">Decrease adjustment.</E> A determination by the OCC to decrease the established countercyclical capital buffer amount under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be effective on the day following announcement of the final determination or the earliest date permissible under applicable law or regulation, whichever is later.</P>
        <P>(vi) <E T="03">Twelve month sunset.</E> The countercyclical capital buffer amount will return to zero percent 12 months after the effective date that the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount is announced, unless the OCC announces a decision to maintain the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount or adjust it again before the expiration of the 12-month period.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Countercyclical capital buffer amount for foreign jurisdictions.</E> The OCC will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for private sector credit exposures to reflect decisions made by foreign jurisdictions consistent with due process requirements described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Guarantees and credit derivatives: substitution treatment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative by substituting the risk weight associated with the protection provider for the risk weight assigned to an exposure, as provided under this section.</P>
          <P>(2) This section applies to exposures for which:</P>
          <P>(i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the national bank or Federal savings association and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(3) Exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) generally are securitization exposures subject to §§ 3.41 through 3.45.</P>
          <P>(4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules of recognition.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.</P>
          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:</P>
          <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is subordinated to, the hedged exposure; and<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to ensure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligated party of the hedged exposure fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Substitution approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure by substituting the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider under § 3.32 for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in §§ 3.36(a) and 3.37(b) and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(i) The national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the protected exposure under § 3.32, where the applicable risk weight is the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider.</P>
          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the unprotected exposure under § 3.32, where the applicable risk weight is that of the unprotected portion of the hedged exposure.</P>
          <P>(iii) The treatment provided in this section is applicable when the credit risk of an exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis and may be applicable when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch adjustment.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
          <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
          <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligated party of the hedged exposure is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the hedged exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the national bank or Federal savings association to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.</P>
          <P>(4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</P>
          <P>(5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant: Pm = E × (t − 0.25) / (T − 0.25), where:</P>

          <P>(i) Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;<PRTPAGE P="79"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) E = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant;</P>
          <P>(iii) t = the lesser of T or the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant, expressed in years; and</P>
          <P>(iv) T = the lesser of five or the residual maturity of the hedged exposure, expressed in years.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjustment for credit derivatives without restructuring as a credit event.</E> If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible credit derivative that does not include as a credit event a restructuring of the hedged exposure involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit loss event (that is, a charge-off, specific provision, or other similar debit to the profit and loss account), the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit derivative: Pr = Pm × 0.60, where:</P>
          <P>(1) Pr = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for lack of restructuring event (and maturity mismatch, if applicable); and</P>
          <P>(2) Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch, if applicable).</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Currency mismatch adjustment.</E> (1) If a national bank or Federal savings association recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative that is denominated in a currency different from that in which the hedged exposure is denominated, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following formula to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative: Pc = Pr × (1−H<E T="52">FX</E>), where:</P>
          <P>(i) Pc = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for currency mismatch (and maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable);</P>
          <P>(ii) Pr = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant (adjusted for maturity mismatch and lack of restructuring event, if applicable); and</P>
          <P>(iii) H<E T="52">FX</E> = haircut appropriate for the currency mismatch between the credit risk mitigant and the hedged exposure.</P>

          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must set H<E T="52">FX</E> equal to eight percent unless it qualifies for the use of and uses its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility based on a ten-business-day holding period. A national bank or Federal savings association qualifies for the use of its own internal estimates of foreign exchange volatility if it qualifies for the use of its own-estimates haircuts in § 3.37(c)(4).</P>

          <P>(3) A national bank or Federal savings association must adjust H<E T="52">FX</E> calculated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section upward if the national bank or Federal savings association revalues the guarantee or credit derivative less frequently than once every 10 business days using the following square root of time formula:</P>

          <P>(B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk weight substitution.</E> (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral under § 3.32. For repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions, the collateral is the instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction.

          <P>(i) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a zero percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contract is collateralized by cash on deposit.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 3.32.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:</P>

If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

          <P>(D) A national bank or Federal savings association is required to calculate its own internal estimates with inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the security or category of securities.</P>
          <P>(E) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the national bank's or Federal savings association's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.</P>

          <P>(ii) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must at a minimum take into account:</P>

          <P>(v) A national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</P>

          <P>(1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.</P>
          <P>(2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.</P>
          <P>(3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</P>
          <P>(4) Positive current exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the counterparty.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</P>
          <P>(1) Cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</P>
          <P>(2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions;</P>
          <P>(3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or</P>
          <P>(4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts as provided in § 3.34).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">System-wide failures.</E> In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the OCC may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the national bank or Federal savings association by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 3.38.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
          <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
          <P>(2) The national bank or Federal savings association has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
          <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
          <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>
          <P>(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.</E> For synthetic securitizations, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
          <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
          <P>(i) Financial collateral;<PRTPAGE P="86"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 3.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or</P>

          <P>(ii) Require the national bank or Federal savings association to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
          <P>(iii) Increase the national bank's or Federal savings association's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
          <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the national bank or Federal savings association in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
          <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the national bank or Federal savings association after the inception of the securitization;</P>
          <P>(3) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>

The national bank's or Federal savings association's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.</P>

          <P>(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Securitization risk weight approaches.</E> Except as provided elsewhere in this section or in § 3.41:</P>
          <P>(1) A national bank or Federal savings association must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.</P>
          <P>(2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with §§ 3.43(a) through 3.43(d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 3.43(e), provided, however, that such national bank or Federal savings association must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the national bank or Federal savings association cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 3.44.</P>
          <P>(4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by a national bank or Federal savings association in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), a national bank or Federal savings association may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.</E> A national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the national bank or Federal savings association risk weights under §§ 3.41(c), 3.42(a)(1), and 3.43, 3.44, or § 3.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Exposure amount of a securitization exposure</E>—(1) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2), a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures held by a national bank or Federal savings association that has made an AOCI opt-out election.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security held by a national bank or Federal savings association that has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2) is the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Off-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a <PRTPAGE P="88"/>credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the national bank or Federal savings association could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and derivative contracts.</E> The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 3.34 or § 3.37, as applicable.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Overlapping exposures.</E> If a national bank or Federal savings association has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when a national bank or Federal savings association provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the national bank or Federal savings association may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Implicit support.</E> If a national bank or Federal savings association provides support to a securitization in excess of the national bank's or Federal savings association's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):</P>
          <P>(1) The national bank or Federal savings association must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and</P>
          <P>(2) The national bank or Federal savings association must disclose publicly:</P>
          <P>(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The risk-based capital impact to the national bank or Federal savings association of providing such implicit support.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</P>
          <P>(2) For a national bank or Federal savings association that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the national bank or Federal savings association may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest-only mortgage-backed securities.</E> Regardless of any other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with retained contractual exposure.</E> (1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association that has transferred <PRTPAGE P="89"/>small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.</P>
          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the national bank's or Federal savings association's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.</P>
          <P>(iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).</P>
          <P>(iv) The national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 6.4. For purposes of determining whether a national bank or Federal savings association is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).</P>
          <P>(2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by a national bank or Federal savings association on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.</P>
          <P>(3) If a national bank or Federal savings association ceases to be well capitalized under 12 CFR 6.4 or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the national bank or Federal savings association was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.</P>
          <P>(4) The risk-based capital ratios of the national bank or Federal savings association must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for purposes of:</P>
          <P>(i) Determining whether a national bank or Federal savings association is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under the OCC's prompt corrective action regulations; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Reclassifying a well-capitalized national bank or Federal savings association to adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized national bank or Federal savings association to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the national bank or Federal savings association were in the next lower prompt-corrective-action category.</P>

            <E T="03">-to-default credit derivatives</E>—(1) <E T="03">Protection provider.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk weight using the SSFA in § 3.43 to an n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (i). A national bank or Federal savings association must determine its exposure in the n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.</P>
          <P>(2) For purposes of determining the risk weight for an n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:</P>

          <P>(i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure.<PRTPAGE P="90"/>
          </P>

          <P>(ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals the sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure in the n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

          <P>(3) A national bank or Federal savings association that does not use the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Protection purchaser</E>—(i) <E T="03">First-to-default credit derivatives.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the national bank or Federal savings association synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 3.34 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 3.36(b).</P>

          <P>(B) If a national bank or Federal savings association satisfies the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the national bank or Federal savings association had only synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the n<E T="51">th</E> smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) and the gross-up approach.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for the SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:</P>
          <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using this subpart. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
          <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
          <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
          <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
          <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
          <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
          <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
          <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
          <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>

          <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 3.42(i) for n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

          <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section <PRTPAGE P="92"/>42(i) for n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
          <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section and a risk weight of 20 percent.</P>

          <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.</P>

          <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

          <P>(e) <E T="03">Gross-up approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that is not subject to subpart F of this part may apply the gross-up approach set forth in this section instead of the SSFA to determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures, provided that it applies the gross-up approach to all of its securitization exposures, except as otherwise provided for certain securitization exposures in §§ 3.44 and 3.45.</P>
          <P>(2) To use the gross-up approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the following four inputs:</P>

          <P>(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the national bank's or Federal <PRTPAGE P="94"/>savings association's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;</P>

          <P>(iii) Exposure amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure calculated under § 3.42(c); and</P>
          <P>(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this subpart.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit equivalent amount.</E> The credit equivalent amount of a securitization exposure under this section equals the sum of:</P>
          <P>(i) The exposure amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's securitization exposure; and</P>

          <P>(4) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets.</E> To calculate risk-weighted assets for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, a national bank or Federal savings association must apply the risk weight required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the credit equivalent amount calculated in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk weight of not less than 20 percent to a securitization exposure.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to an investment fund, a national bank or Federal savings association must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in 3.52. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the look-through approaches provided in § 3.53 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.</P>
          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 3.2) as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 3.53.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Stable value protection.</E> (i) Stable value protection means a contract where the provider of the contract is obligated to pay:</P>
          <P>(A) The policy owner of a separate account an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and cost basis of the separate account when the policy owner of the separate account surrenders the policy; or</P>
          <P>(B) The beneficiary of the contract an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and book value of a specified portfolio of assets.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases stable value protection on its investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of its investment in the separate account attributable to the stable value protection as an exposure to the provider of the protection and the remaining portion of the carrying value of its separate account as an equity exposure to an investment fund.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association that provides stable value protection must treat the exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carrying value determined as the sum of paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjusted carrying value.</E> For purposes of §§ 3.51 through 3.53, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is:</P>
          <P>(1) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure (other than an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2)), the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of the exposure;</P>
          <P>(2) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is classified as available-for-sale where the national bank or Federal savings association has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 3.22(b)(2), the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value of the exposure less any net unrealized gains on the exposure that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the national bank's or Federal savings association's regulatory capital components;</P>
          <P>(3) For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is not an equity commitment, the effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and</P>

          <P>(4) For a commitment to acquire an equity exposure (an equity commitment), the effective notional principal amount of the exposure is multiplied <PRTPAGE P="96"/>by the following conversion factors (CFs):</P>
          <P>(i) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of one year or less receive a CF of 20 percent.</P>
          <P>(ii) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of over one year receive a CF of 50 percent.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Simple risk-weight approach (SRWA).</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under the SRWA, a national bank's or Federal savings association's total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined under this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined under § 3.53.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">SRWA computation for individual equity exposures.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest applicable risk weight in this paragraph (b).</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Zero percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, an MDB, and any other entity whose credit exposures receive a zero percent risk weight under § 3.32 may be assigned a zero percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">20 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to a PSE, Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) must be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">100 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> The equity exposures set forth in this paragraph (b)(3) must be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Community development equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.</P>

          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-significant equity exposures.</E> Equity exposures, excluding significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.</P>

          <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a national bank or Federal savings association does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within <PRTPAGE P="97"/>the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</P>
          <P>(B) When determining which of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures qualify for a 100 percent risk weight under this paragraph (b), a national bank or Federal savings association first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">250 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to § 3.22(d) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">300 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> A publicly traded equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge pair) must be assigned a 300 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">400 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(7)) of this section that is not publicly traded must be assigned a 400 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">600 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure to an investment firm must be assigned a 600 percent risk weight, provided that the investment firm:</P>
          <P>(i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of that definition; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Has greater than immaterial leverage.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Hedge transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Hedge pair.</E> A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective hedge.</E> Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the national bank or Federal savings association acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the national bank or Federal savings association will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A national bank or Federal savings association must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E as set forth in this paragraph (c).</P>
          <P>(i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the national bank or Federal savings association must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.</P>
          <P>(ii) Under the variability-reduction method of measuring effectiveness:</P>

            <GID>er11oc13.027</GID>
          </GPH>
          <P>(iii) Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then E equals zero.</P>
          <P>(3) The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.</P>
          <P>(4) The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming a hedge pair.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Equity exposures to investment funds.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Available approaches.</E> (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure under § 3.52(b)(3)(i), a national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach described in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alterative modified look-through approach described paragraph (d) of this section, provided, however, that the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an equity exposure under this section is 20 percent.</P>
          <P>(2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.52(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.</P>
          <P>(3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the national bank or Federal savings association does not use the full look-through approach, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 3.52(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Full look-through approach.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</P>

          <P>(1) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association; and<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of the fund.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Simple modified look-through approach.</E> Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under this subpart based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under this subpart. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under this subpart and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under this subpart until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the highest applicable risk weight. A national bank or Federal savings association may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

          <P>Sections 3.61-3.63 of this subpart establish public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements described in subpart B of this part for a national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent year-end Call Report that is not an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association making public disclosures pursuant to § 3.172. An advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has not received approval from the OCC to exit parallel run pursuant to § 3.121(d) is subject to the disclosure requirements described in §§ 3.62 and 3.63. Such a national bank or Federal savings association must comply with § 3.62 unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, total consolidated assets are determined based on the average of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total consolidated assets in the four most recent quarters as reported on the Call Report; or the average of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total consolidated assets in the most recent consecutive quarters as reported quarterly on the national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report if the national bank or Federal savings association has not filed such a report for each of the most recent four quarters.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 3.63. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. The national bank's or Federal savings association's management may provide all of the disclosures required by §§ 3.61 through 3.63 in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
          <P>(b) A national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
          <P>(c) If a national bank or Federal savings association described in § 3.61 concludes that specific commercial or financial information that it would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would be exempt from disclosure by the OCC under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), then the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, and principle of conservatism.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart E establishes:</P>
        <P>(1) Minimum qualifying criteria for national banks or Federal savings associations using institution-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and</P>
        <P>(2) Methodologies for such national banks or Federal savings associations to calculate their total risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart applies to a national bank or Federal savings association that:</P>
        <P>(i) Has consolidated total assets, as reported on its most recent year-end Call Report equal to $250 billion or more;</P>
        <P>(ii) Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure on its most recent year-end Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Report equal to $10 billion or more (where total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total foreign countries cross-border claims on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign countries claims on local residents on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign countries fair value of foreign exchange and derivative products), calculated in accordance with the FFIEC 009 Country Exposure Report;</P>
        <P>(iii) Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to subpart E of 12 CFR part 3 (OCC), 12 CFR part 217 (Board), or 12 CFR part 325 (FDIC) to calculate its total risk-weighted assets;</P>
        <P>(iv) Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its total risk-weighted assets; or</P>
        <P>(v) Elects to use this subpart to calculate its total risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association that is subject to this subpart shall remain subject to this subpart unless the OCC determines in writing that application of this subpart is not appropriate in light of the national bank's or Federal savings association's asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or scope of operations. In making a determination under this paragraph (b), the OCC will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 3.404.</P>
        <P>(3) A market risk national bank or Federal savings association must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of conservatism.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) The national bank or Federal savings association can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the OCC that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;</P>
        <P>(2) The national bank or Federal savings association appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;</P>
        <P>(3) The national bank or Federal savings association notifies the OCC in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</P>
        <P>(4) The exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>

          <E T="03">Exposure at default (EAD)</E> means:</P>
        <P>(1) For the on-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, a cleared transaction, or default fund contribution), EAD means the national bank's or Federal savings association's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees) for the exposure or segment less any allocated transfer risk reserve for the exposure or segment.</P>

        <P>(2) For the off-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, cleared transaction, or default fund contribution) in the form of a loan commitment, line of credit, trade-related letter of credit, or transaction-related contingency, EAD means the national bank's or Federal savings association's best estimate of net additions to the outstanding <PRTPAGE P="110"/>amount owed the national bank or Federal savings association, including estimated future additional draws of principal and accrued but unpaid interest and fees, that are likely to occur over a one-year horizon assuming the wholesale exposure or the retail exposures in the segment were to go into default. This estimate of net additions must reflect what would be expected during economic downturn conditions. For the purposes of this definition:</P>
        <P>(i) Trade-related letters of credit are short-term, self-liquidating instruments that are used to finance the movement of goods and are collateralized by the underlying goods.</P>
        <P>(ii) Transaction-related contingencies relate to a particular transaction and include, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based letters of credit.</P>
        <P>(3) For the off-balance sheet component of a wholesale exposure or segment of retail exposures (other than an OTC derivative contract, a repo-style transaction, or eligible margin loan for which the national bank or Federal savings association determines EAD under § 3.132, cleared transaction, or default fund contribution) in the form of anything other than a loan commitment, line of credit, trade-related letter of credit, or transaction-related contingency, EAD means the notional amount of the exposure or segment.</P>
        <P>(4) EAD for OTC derivative contracts is calculated as described in § 3.132. A national bank or Federal savings association also may determine EAD for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans as described in § 3.132.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Exposure category</E> means any of the wholesale, retail, securitization, or equity exposure categories.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">External operational loss event data</E> means, with respect to a national bank or Federal savings association, gross operational loss amounts, dates, recoveries, and relevant causal information for operational loss events occurring at organizations other than the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">IMM exposure</E> means a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or OTC derivative for which a national bank or Federal savings association calculates its EAD using the internal models methodology of § 3.132(d).</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Internal operational loss event data</E> means, with respect to a national bank or Federal savings association, gross operational loss amounts, dates, recoveries, and relevant causal information for operational loss events occurring at the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>
        <P>

        <P>(1) For a wholesale exposure, the greatest of:</P>
        <P>(i) Zero;</P>
        <P>(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run default-weighted average economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the national bank or Federal savings association to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon over a mix of economic conditions, including economic downturn conditions; or</P>
        <P>(iii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the obligor (or a typical obligor in the loss severity grade assigned by the national bank or Federal savings association to the exposure) were to default within a one-year horizon during economic downturn conditions.</P>
        <P>(2) For a segment of retail exposures, the greatest of:</P>
        <P>(i) Zero;</P>
        <P>(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the long-run default-weighted average economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the exposures in the segment were to default within a one-year horizon over a mix of economic conditions, including economic downturn conditions; or</P>

        <P>(iii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the economic loss, per dollar of EAD, the national bank or Federal savings association would expect to incur if the exposures in the segment were to default within a one-<PRTPAGE P="111"/>year horizon during economic downturn conditions.</P>
        <P>(3) The economic loss on an exposure in the event of default is all material credit-related losses on the exposure (including accrued but unpaid interest or fees, losses on the sale of collateral, direct workout costs, and an appropriate allocation of indirect workout costs). Where positive or negative cash flows on a wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor or a defaulted retail exposure (including proceeds from the sale of collateral, workout costs, additional extensions of credit to facilitate repayment of the exposure, and draw-downs of unused credit lines) occur after the date of default, the economic loss must reflect the net present value of cash flows as of the default date using a discount rate appropriate to the risk of the defaulted exposure.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Obligor</E> means the legal entity or natural person contractually obligated on a wholesale exposure, except that a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the following exposures as having separate obligors:</P>
        <P>(1) Exposures to the same legal entity or natural person denominated in different currencies;</P>
        <P>(2)(i) An income-producing real estate exposure for which all or substantially all of the repayment of the exposure is reliant on the cash flows of the real estate serving as collateral for the exposure; the national bank or Federal savings association, in economic substance, does not have recourse to the borrower beyond the real estate collateral; and no cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place other than clauses obtained solely out of an abundance of caution; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Other credit exposures to the same legal entity or natural person; and</P>
        <P>(3)(i) A wholesale exposure authorized under section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 364) to a legal entity or natural person who is a debtor-in-possession for purposes of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Other credit exposures to the same legal entity or natural person.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Operational loss</E> means a loss (excluding insurance or tax effects) resulting from an operational loss event. Operational loss includes all expenses associated with an operational loss event except for opportunity costs, forgone revenue, and costs related to risk management and control enhancements implemented to prevent future operational losses.</P>

The implementation plan must incorporate an explicit start date no later than 36 months after the date the national bank or Federal savings association meets at least one criterion under § 3.100(b)(1)(i) through (iv). The OCC may extend the start date.</P>

          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association that elects to be subject to this appendix under § 3.100(b)(1)(v) must adopt a written implementation plan.<PRTPAGE P="114"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Implementation plan.</E> (1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's implementation plan must address in detail how the national bank or Federal savings association complies, or plans to comply, with the qualification requirements in § 3.122. The national bank or Federal savings association also must maintain a comprehensive and sound planning and governance process to oversee the implementation efforts described in the plan. At a minimum, the plan must:</P>
          <P>(i) Comprehensively address the qualification requirements in § 3.122 for the national bank or Federal savings association and each consolidated subsidiary (U.S. and foreign-based) of the national bank or Federal savings association with respect to all portfolios and exposures of the national bank or Federal savings association and each of its consolidated subsidiaries;</P>
          <P>(ii) Justify and support any proposed temporary or permanent exclusion of business lines, portfolios, or exposures from the application of the advanced approaches in this subpart (which business lines, portfolios, and exposures must be, in the aggregate, immaterial to the national bank or Federal savings association);</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Parallel run.</E> Before determining its risk-weighted assets under this subpart and following adoption of the implementation plan, the national bank or Federal savings association must conduct a satisfactory parallel run. A satisfactory parallel run is a period of no less than four consecutive calendar quarters during which the national bank or Federal savings association complies with the qualification requirements in § 3.122 to the satisfaction of the OCC. During the parallel run, the national bank or Federal savings association must report to the OCC on a calendar quarterly basis its risk-based capital ratios determined in accordance with § 3.10(b)(1) through (3) and § 3.10 (c)(1) through (3).

          <SECTNO>§ 3.122</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Qualification requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Process and systems requirements.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.</P>
          <P>(2) The systems and processes used by a national bank or Federal savings association for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart must be consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk management processes and management information reporting systems.</P>
          <P>(3) Each national bank or Federal savings association must have an appropriate infrastructure with risk measurement and management processes that meet the qualification requirements of this section and are appropriate given the national bank's or Federal savings association's size and level of complexity. Regardless of whether the systems and models that generate the risk parameters necessary for calculating a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirements are located at any affiliate of the national bank or Federal savings association, the national bank or Federal savings association itself must ensure that the risk parameters and reference data used to determine its risk-based capital requirements are representative of long run experience with respect to its own credit risk and operational risk exposures.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Risk rating and segmentation systems for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1)(i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating and segmentation system that accurately, reliably, and meaningfully differentiates among degrees of credit risk for the national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale and retail exposures. When assigning an internal risk rating, a national bank or Federal savings association may consider a third-party assessment of credit risk, provided that the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating assignment does not rely solely on the external assessment.</P>
          <P>(ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses multiple rating or segmentation systems, the national bank's or Federal savings association's rationale for assigning an obligor or exposure to a particular system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the obligor's or exposure's level of risk. A national bank or Federal savings association must not inappropriately allocate obligors or exposures across systems to minimize regulatory capital requirements.</P>
          <P>(iii) In assigning ratings to wholesale obligors and exposures, including loss severity ratings grades to wholesale exposures, and assigning retail exposures to retail segments, a national bank or Federal savings association must use all relevant and material information and ensure that the information is current.</P>
          <P>(iv) When assigning an obligor to a PD rating or retail exposure to a PD segment, a national bank or Federal savings association must assess the obligor or retail borrower's ability and willingness to contractually perform, taking a conservative view of projected information.</P>
          <P>(2) For wholesale exposures:</P>

          <P>(i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each obligor to a single rating grade (reflecting the obligor's likelihood of default). A national bank or Federal savings association may elect, however, not to assign to a rating grade an obligor to whom the national bank or Federal savings association extends credit based solely on the financial strength of a guarantor, provided that all of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures to the obligor are fully covered by eligible guarantees, the national bank or <PRTPAGE P="116"/>Federal savings association applies the PD substitution approach in § 3.134(c)(1) to all exposures to that obligor, and the national bank or Federal savings association immediately assigns the obligor to a rating grade if a guarantee can no longer be recognized under this part. The national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale obligor rating system must have at least seven discrete rating grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one rating grade for defaulted obligors.</P>
          <P>(ii) Unless the national bank or Federal savings association has chosen to directly assign LGD estimates to each wholesale exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each wholesale exposure to a loss severity rating grade (reflecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's estimate of the LGD of the exposure). A national bank or Federal savings association employing loss severity rating grades must have a sufficiently granular loss severity grading system to avoid grouping together exposures with widely ranging LGDs.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an effective process to obtain and update in a timely manner relevant and material information on obligor and exposure characteristics that affect PD, LGD and EAD.</P>
          <P>(3) For retail exposures:</P>
          <P>(i) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal system that groups retail exposures into the appropriate retail exposure subcategory and groups the retail exposures in each retail exposure subcategory into separate segments with homogeneous risk characteristics that provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. The national bank's or Federal savings association's system must identify and group in separate segments by subcategories exposures identified in § 3.131(c)(2)(ii) and (iii).</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal system that captures all relevant exposure risk characteristics, including borrower credit score, product and collateral types, as well as exposure delinquencies, and must consider cross-collateral provisions, where present.</P>
          <P>(iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and, if appropriate, update assignments of individual retail exposures to segments and the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk segment. These reviews must occur whenever the national bank or Federal savings association receives new material information, but generally no less frequently than quarterly, and, in all cases, at least annually.</P>
          <P>(4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating policy for wholesale exposures must describe the national bank's or Federal savings association's rating philosophy (that is, must describe how wholesale obligor rating assignments are affected by the national bank's or Federal savings association's choice of the range of economic, business, and industry conditions that are considered in the obligor rating process).</P>
          <P>(5) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk rating system for wholesale exposures must provide for the review and update (as appropriate) of each obligor rating and (if applicable) each loss severity rating whenever the national bank or Federal savings association obtains relevant and material information on the obligor or exposure that affects PD, LGD and EAD, but no less frequently than annually.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Quantification of risk parameters for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a comprehensive risk parameter quantification process that produces accurate, timely, and reliable estimates of the risk parameters on a consistent basis for the national bank's or Federal savings association's wholesale and retail exposures.</P>

          <P>(2) A national bank's or Federal savings association's estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material, and available data that is reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual wholesale and retail exposures and of sufficient quality to support the determination of risk-based capital requirements for the exposures. In particular, the population of exposures in the data used for estimation purposes, the lending standards in use when the data <PRTPAGE P="117"/>were generated, and other relevant characteristics, should closely match or be comparable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures and standards. In addition, a national bank or Federal savings association must:</P>
          <P>(i) Demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience, including periods of economic downturn conditions, whether internal or external data are used;</P>
          <P>(ii) Take into account any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period;</P>
          <P>(iii) Promptly reflect technical advances, new data, and other information as they become available;</P>
          <P>(iv) Demonstrate that the data used to estimate risk parameters support the accuracy and robustness of those estimates; and</P>
          <P>(v) Demonstrate that its estimation technique performs well in out-of-sample tests whenever possible.</P>
          <P>(3) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk parameter quantification process must produce appropriately conservative risk parameter estimates where the national bank or Federal savings association has limited relevant data, and any adjustments that are part of the quantification process must not result in a pattern of bias toward lower risk parameter estimates.</P>
          <P>(4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk parameter estimation process should not rely on the possibility of U.S. government financial assistance, except for the financial assistance that the U.S. government has a legally binding commitment to provide.</P>
          <P>(5) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to demonstrate which variables have been found to be statistically significant with regard to EAD. The national bank's or Federal savings association's EAD estimates must reflect its specific policies and strategies with regard to account management, including account monitoring and payment processing, and its ability and willingness to prevent further drawdowns in circumstances short of payment default. The national bank or Federal savings association must have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor current outstanding amounts against committed lines, and changes in outstanding amounts per obligor and obligor rating grade and per retail segment. The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to monitor outstanding amounts on a daily basis.</P>
          <P>(6) At a minimum, PD estimates for wholesale obligors and retail segments must be based on at least five years of default data. LGD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of loss severity data, and LGD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of loss severity data. EAD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of exposure amount data, and EAD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of exposure amount data. If the national bank or Federal savings association has relevant and material reference data that span a longer period of time than the minimum time periods specified above, the national bank or Federal savings association must incorporate such data in its estimates, provided that it does not place undue weight on periods of favorable or benign economic conditions relative to periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
          <P>(7) Default, loss severity, and exposure amount data must include periods of economic downturn conditions, or the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust its estimates of risk parameters to compensate for the lack of data from periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
          <P>(8) The national bank's or Federal savings association's PD, LGD, and EAD estimates must be based on the definition of default in § 3.101.</P>

          <P>(9) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal data obtained prior to becoming subject to this subpart E or external data to arrive at PD, LGD, or EAD estimates, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the OCC that the national bank or Federal savings association has made appropriate adjustments if necessary to be consistent with the definition of default in <PRTPAGE P="118"/>§ 3.101. Internal data obtained after the national bank or Federal savings association becomes subject to this subpart E must be consistent with the definition of default in § 3.101.</P>
          <P>(10) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and update (as appropriate) its risk parameters and its risk parameter quantification process at least annually.</P>
          <P>(11) The national bank or Federal savings association must, at least annually, conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of reference data to determine relevance of the reference data to the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposures, quality of reference data to support PD, LGD, and EAD estimates, and consistency of reference data to the definition of default in § 3.101.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Counterparty credit risk model.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.132 to use the internal models methodology for counterparty credit risk and the advanced CVA approach for the CVA capital requirement.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Double default treatment.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.135 to use the double default treatment.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Equity exposures model.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC under § 3.153 to use the internal models approach for equity exposures.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Operational risk.</E> (1) Operational risk management processes. A national bank or Federal savings association must:</P>
          <P>(i) Have an operational risk management function that:</P>
          <P>(A) Is independent of business line management; and</P>
          <P>(B) Is responsible for designing, implementing, and overseeing the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk data and assessment systems, operational risk quantification systems, and related processes;</P>
          <P>(ii) Have and document a process (which must capture business environment and internal control factors affecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk profile) to identify, measure, monitor, and control operational risk in the national bank's or Federal savings association's products, activities, processes, and systems; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Report operational risk exposures, operational loss events, and other relevant operational risk information to business unit management, senior management, and the board of directors (or a designated committee of the board).</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Operational risk data and assessment systems.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must have operational risk data and assessment systems that capture operational risks to which the national bank or Federal savings association is exposed. The national bank's or Federal savings association's operational risk data and assessment systems must:</P>
          <P>(i) Be structured in a manner consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's current business activities, risk profile, technological processes, and risk management processes; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Include credible, transparent, systematic, and verifiable processes that incorporate the following elements on an ongoing basis:</P>
          <P>(A) <E T="03">Internal operational loss event data.</E> The national bank or Federal savings association must have a systematic process for capturing and using internal operational loss event data in its operational risk data and assessment systems.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Mechanics for calculating total wholesale and retail risk-weighted assets.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its total wholesale and retail risk-weighted asset amount in four distinct phases:</P>
          <P>(1) Phase 1—categorization of exposures;</P>
          <P>(2) Phase 2—assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and segmentation of retail exposures;</P>
          <P>(3) Phase 3—assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures; and</P>
          <P>(4) Phase 4—calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Phase 1—Categorization.</E> The national bank or Federal savings association must determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The national bank or Federal savings association must categorize each retail exposure as a residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or an other retail exposure. The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which wholesale exposures are HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions to which § 3.136 applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are used as credit risk mitigants. The national bank or Federal savings association must identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, as well as any non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Phase 2—Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and retail exposures to segments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades.</E> (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must assign each obligor of a wholesale exposure to a single obligor rating grade and must assign each wholesale exposure to which it does not directly assign an LGD estimate to a loss severity rating grade.</P>
          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its wholesale obligors are in default.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Segmentation of retail exposures.</E> (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.</P>
          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its retail exposures are in default. The national bank or Federal savings association must segment defaulted retail exposures separately from non-defaulted retail exposures.</P>

          <P>(iii) If the national bank or Federal savings association determines the EAD for eligible margin loans using the approach in § 3.132(b), the national bank or Federal savings association must identify which of its retail exposures are eligible margin loans for which the national bank or Federal savings association uses this EAD approach and must segment such eligible margin loans separately from other retail exposures.<PRTPAGE P="123"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may group its eligible purchased wholesale exposures into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the wholesale exposure formula in Table 1 of this section to determine the risk-based capital requirement for each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Phase 3—Assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Quantification process.</E> Subject to the limitations in this paragraph (d), the national bank or Federal savings association must:</P>
          <P>(i) Associate a PD with each wholesale obligor rating grade;</P>
          <P>(ii) Associate an LGD with each wholesale loss severity rating grade or assign an LGD to each wholesale exposure;</P>
          <P>(iii) Assign an EAD and M to each wholesale exposure; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Assign a PD, LGD, and EAD to each segment of retail exposures.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Floor on PD assignment.</E> The PD for each wholesale obligor or retail segment may not be less than 0.03 percent, except for exposures to or directly and unconditionally guaranteed by a sovereign entity, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, or a multilateral development bank, to which the national bank or Federal savings association assigns a rating grade associated with a PD of less than 0.03 percent.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Floor on LGD estimation.</E> The LGD for each segment of residential mortgage exposures may not be less than 10 percent, except for segments of residential mortgage exposures for which all or substantially all of the principal of each exposure is either:</P>
          <P>(i) Directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a sovereign entity; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Guaranteed by a contingent obligation of the U.S. government or its agencies, the enforceability of which is dependent upon some affirmative action on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party (for example, meeting servicing requirements).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a PD, LGD, EAD, and M to each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures. If the national bank or Federal savings association can estimate ECL (but not PD or LGD) for a segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the LGD of the segment equals 100 percent and that the PD of the segment equals ECL divided by EAD. The estimated ECL must be calculated for the exposures without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Credit risk mitigation: credit derivatives, guarantees, and collateral.</E> (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives in support of a wholesale exposure by applying the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment to the exposure as provided in § 3.134 or, if applicable, applying double default treatment to the exposure as provided in § 3.135. A national bank or Federal savings association may decide separately for each wholesale exposure that qualifies for the double default treatment under § 3.135 whether to apply the double default treatment or to use the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment without recognizing double default effects.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of guarantees and credit derivatives in support of retail exposures in a segment when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In doing so, a national bank or Federal savings association must consider all relevant available information.</P>

          <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of a wholesale exposure when quantifying the LGD of the exposure, and may take into account the risk reducing effects <PRTPAGE P="124"/>of collateral in support of retail exposures when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In order to do so, a national bank or Federal savings association must have established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty, and risk management processes.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, and eligible margin loans.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its EAD for an OTC derivative contract as provided in § 3.132 (c) and (d). A national bank or Federal savings association may take into account the risk-reducing effects of financial collateral in support of a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan and of any collateral in support of a repo-style transaction that is included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part through an adjustment to EAD as provided in § 3.132(b) and (d). A national bank or Federal savings association that takes collateral into account through such an adjustment to EAD under § 3.132 may not reflect such collateral in LGD.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Effective maturity.</E> An exposure's M must be no greater than five years and no less than one year, except that an exposure's M must be no less than one day if the exposure is a trade related letter of credit, or if the exposure has an original maturity of less than one year and is not part of a national bank's or Federal savings association's ongoing financing of the obligor. An exposure is not part of a national bank's or Federal savings association's ongoing financing of the obligor if the national bank or Federal savings association:</P>
          <P>(i) Has a legal and practical ability not to renew or roll over the exposure in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor;</P>
          <P>(ii) Makes an independent credit decision at the inception of the exposure and at every renewal or roll over; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Has no substantial commercial incentive to continue its credit relationship with the obligor in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">EAD for exposures to certain central counterparties.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may attribute an EAD of zero to exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing counterparty credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Phase 4—Calculation of risk-weighted assets</E>—(1) <E T="03">Non-defaulted exposures.</E> (i) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the dollar risk-based capital requirement for each of its wholesale exposures to a non-defaulted obligor (except for eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives that hedge another wholesale exposure, IMM exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions, and exposures to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies the double default treatment in § 3.135) and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures by inserting the assigned risk parameters for the wholesale obligor and exposure or retail segment into the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 and multiplying the output of the formula (K) by the EAD of the exposure or segment. Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply a 300 percent risk weight to the EAD of an eligible margin loan if the national bank or Federal savings association is not able to meet the OCC's requirements for estimation of PD and LGD for the margin loan.</P>

          <P>(iii) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.</P>

          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Covered by an eligible U.S. government guarantee:</E> The dollar risk-based capital requirement for each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and each segment of defaulted retail exposures covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government equals the sum of:<PRTPAGE P="127"/>
          </P>
          <P>(A) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.016, and</P>
          <P>(B) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.08.</P>
          <P>(iii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section plus the dollar risk-based capital requirements each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and for each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.</P>
          <P>(iv) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to defaulted obligors and segments of defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Assets not included in a defined exposure category.</E> (i) A national bank or Federal savings association may assign a risk-weighted asset amount of zero to cash owned and held in all offices of the national bank or Federal savings association or in transit and for gold bullion held in the national bank's or Federal savings association's own vaults, or held in another national bank's or Federal savings association's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent the gold bullion assets are offset by gold bullion liabilities.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to 20 percent of the carrying value of cash items in the process of collection.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to 50 percent of the carrying value to a pre-sold construction loan unless the purchase contract is cancelled, in which case a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to a 100 percent of the carrying value of the pre-sold construction loan.</P>
          <P>(iv) The risk-weighted asset amount for the residual value of a retail lease exposure equals such residual value.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Methodologies for collateral recognition.</E> (1) Instead of an LGD estimation methodology, a national bank or Federal savings association may use the following methodologies to recognize the benefits of financial collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized OTC derivative contracts and single product netting sets of such transactions, and to recognize the benefits of any collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions that are included in a national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part:</P>
          <P>(i) The collateral haircut approach set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) The internal models methodology set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(iii) For single product netting sets of repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans, the simple VaR methodology set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association may use any combination of the three methodologies for collateral recognition; however, it must use the same methodology for transactions in the same category.</P>
          <P>(3) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the methodology in paragraph (c) of this section, or with prior written approval of the OCC, the internal model methodology in paragraph (d) of this section, to calculate EAD for an OTC derivative contract or a set of OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. To estimate EAD for qualifying cross-product master netting agreements, a national bank or Federal savings association may only use the internal models methodology in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) A national bank or Federal savings association must also use the methodology in paragraph (e) of this section to calculate the risk-weighted asset amounts for CVA for OTC derivatives.</P>

Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association may estimate an unsecured LGD for the exposure, as well as for any repo-style transaction that is included in the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part, and determine the EAD of the exposure using:</P>

If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward on the basis of a holding period of twenty business days. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must adjust the supervisory haircuts upward for that netting set on the basis of a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.

          <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the national bank's or Federal savings association's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Nothing in this section prevents the OCC from requiring a national bank or Federal savings association to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of own internal estimates for haircuts.</P>

          <P>(B) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must at a minimum take into account:</P>

          <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The interest rate sensitivity of the security.</P>
          <P>(C) With respect to debt securities that are not investment grade and equity securities, a national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate haircut for each individual security.</P>
          <P>(D) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.</P>

          <P>(E) A national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and <PRTPAGE P="132"/>foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Simple VaR methodology.</E> With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may estimate EAD for a netting set using a VaR model that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In such event, the national bank or Federal savings association must set EAD equal to max {0, [(ΣE − ΣC) + PFE]}, where:</P>
          <P>(i) ΣE equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the netting set);</P>
          <P>(ii) ΣC equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the national bank or Federal savings association has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the netting set); and</P>
          <P>(iii) PFE (potential future exposure) equals the national bank's or Federal savings association's empirically based best estimate of the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval for an increase in the value of (ΣE − ΣC) over a five-business-day holding period for repo-style transactions, or over a ten-business-day holding period for eligible margin loans except for netting sets for which paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section applies using a minimum one-year historical observation period of price data representing the instruments that the national bank or Federal savings association has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. The national bank or Federal savings association must validate its VaR model by establishing and maintaining a rigorous and regular backtesting regime.</P>
          <P>(iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a twenty-business-day holding period for the following quarter (except when a national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 3.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, a national bank or Federal savings association must use a twenty-business-day holding period. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the national bank or Federal savings association must set its PFE for that netting set equal to an estimate over a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">OTC derivative contracts not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the EAD for an OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. A national bank or Federal savings association may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the national bank or Federal savings association has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must determine the EAD for multiple OTC derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. A national <PRTPAGE P="133"/>bank or Federal savings association may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(6) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the national bank or Federal savings association has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit derivatives.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:</P>
          <P>(i) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under § 3.134 or § 3.135 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section so long as the national bank or Federal savings association does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that is the protection provider in a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as a wholesale exposure to the reference obligor and is not required to calculate a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this section, so long as it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes all or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes (unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Equity derivatives.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 3.151-3.155 (unless the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the national bank or Federal savings association is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in § 3.155, the national bank or Federal savings association must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Single OTC derivative contract.</E> Except as modified by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the EAD for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the national bank's or Federal savings association's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the derivative contract.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Current credit exposure.</E> The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract or zero; and</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">PFE.</E> The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 2 to § 3.132. For purposes of calculating either the PFE under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the gross PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, the notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. For any OTC derivative <PRTPAGE P="134"/>contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 2 to § 3.132, the PFE must be calculated using the “other” conversion factors. A national bank or Federal savings association must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</P>

Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by estimating an unsecured LGD for the contract or netting set and adjusting the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section using the collateral haircut approach in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The <PRTPAGE P="135"/>national bank or Federal savings association must substitute the EAD calculated under paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section for ∑E in the equation in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and must use a ten-business day minimum holding period (T<E T="52">M</E> = 10) unless a longer holding period is required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section.</P>

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Internal models methodology.</E> (1)(i) With prior written approval from the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may use the internal models methodology in this paragraph (d) to determine EAD for counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts (collateralized or uncollateralized) and single-product netting sets thereof, for eligible margin loans and single-product netting sets thereof, and for repo-style transactions and single-product netting sets thereof.</P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that uses the internal models methodology for a particular transaction type (derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for all transactions of that transaction type. A national bank or Federal savings association may choose to use the internal models methodology for one or two of these three types of exposures and not the other types.</P>
          <P>(iii) A national bank or Federal savings association may also use the internal models methodology for derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, and repo-style transactions subject to a qualifying cross-product netting agreement if:</P>
          <P>(A) The national bank or Federal savings association effectively integrates the risk mitigating effects of cross-product netting into its risk management and other information technology systems; and</P>
          <P>(B) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains the prior written approval of the OCC.</P>
          <P>(iv) A national bank or Federal savings association that uses the internal models methodology for a transaction type must receive approval from the OCC to cease using the methodology for that transaction type or to make a material change to its internal model.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets using IMM.</E> Under the IMM, a national bank or Federal savings association uses an internal model to estimate the expected exposure (EE) for a netting set and then calculates EAD based on that EE. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate two EEs and two EADs (one stressed and one <PRTPAGE P="136"/>unstressed) for each netting set as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) EAD<E T="52">unstressed</E> is calculated using an EE estimate based on the most recent data meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) EAD<E T="52">stressed</E> is calculated using an EE estimate based on a historical period that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties according to paragraph (d)(3)(viii) of this section;</P>
          <P>(iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must use its internal model's probability distribution for changes in the fair value of a netting set that are attributable to changes in market variables to determine EE; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Under the internal models methodology, EAD = Max (0, α × effective EPE − CVA), or, subject to the prior written approval of OCC as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, a more conservative measure of EAD.</P>
          <P>(A) CVA equals the credit valuation adjustment that the national bank or Federal savings association has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (d), CVA does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the national bank's or Federal savings association's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>

          <P>(v) A national bank or Federal savings association may include financial collateral currently posted by the counterparty as collateral (but may not include other forms of collateral) when calculating EE.</P>

          <P>(vi) If a national bank or Federal savings association hedges some or all of the counterparty credit risk associated with a netting set using an eligible credit derivative, the national bank or Federal savings association may take the reduction in exposure to the counterparty into account when estimating EE. If the national bank or Federal savings association recognizes this reduction in exposure to the counterparty in its estimate of EE, it must also use its internal model to estimate a separate EAD for the national bank's or Federal savings association's <PRTPAGE P="137"/>exposure to the protection provider of the credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Prior approval relating to EAD calculation.</E> To obtain OCC approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the following minimum standards, with which the national bank or Federal savings association must maintain compliance:</P>
          <P>(i) The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);</P>
          <P>(ii) The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set;</P>
          <P>(iii) The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;</P>
          <P>(iv) The national bank or Federal savings association must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the whole life of all contracts in the netting set;</P>
          <P>(v) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The national bank or Federal savings association must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements;</P>
          <P>(vi) The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. The procedures must include stress testing and scenario analysis;</P>
          <P>(vii) The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. The national bank or Federal savings association must estimate model parameters using historical data from the most recent three-year period and update the data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The national bank or Federal savings association should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate;</P>
          <P>(viii) When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, the national bank or Federal savings association must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the national bank's or Federal savings association's counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio. The OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;</P>
          <P>(ix) A national bank or Federal savings association must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the national bank or Federal savings association must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;</P>
          <P>(x) A national bank or Federal savings association must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and</P>

          <P>(xi) A national bank or Federal savings association must have a comprehensive stress testing program that captures all credit exposures to <PRTPAGE P="138"/>counterparties, and incorporates stress testing of principal market risk factors and creditworthiness of counterparties.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Calculating the maturity of exposures.</E> (i) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is greater than one year, the national bank or Federal savings association must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to the lower of five years or M(EPE), where:</P>
          <GPH DEEP="119" SPAN="2">
            <GID>ER11OC13.034</GID>
          </GPH>
          <P>(ii) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is one year or less, the national bank or Federal savings association must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to one year, except as provided in § 3.131(d)(7).</P>
          <P>(iii) Alternatively, a national bank or Federal savings association that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment may use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M(EPE) in place of the formula in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Effects of collateral agreements on EAD.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases, but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:</P>
          <P>(i) With prior written approval from the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The national bank or Federal savings association may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral, plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is set according to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(ii) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</P>
          <P>(A) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The current exposure of the netting set reflecting all collateral held or <PRTPAGE P="139"/>posted by the national bank or Federal savings association excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. For purposes of this section, the add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure over the margin period of risk (set in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section); or</P>
          <P>(B) Effective EPE without a collateral agreement plus any collateral the national bank or Federal savings association posts to the counterparty that exceeds the required margin amount.</P>
          <P>(iii) For purposes of this part, including paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the margin period of risk for a netting set subject to a collateral agreement is:</P>
          <P>(A) Five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily remargining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement, or</P>
          <P>(B) Twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter (except if the national bank or Federal savings association is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 3.133) or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the national bank or Federal savings association must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set. If the periodicity of the receipt of collateral is N-days, the minimum margin period of risk is the minimum margin period of risk under this paragraph (d) plus N minus 1. This period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</P>
          <P>(C) Five business days for an OTC derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the national bank or Federal savings association is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the national bank or Federal savings association provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client. A national bank or Federal savings association must use a longer holding period if the national bank or Federal savings association determines that a longer period is appropriate. Additionally, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to set a longer holding period if the OCC determines that a longer period is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Own estimate of alpha.</E> With prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the national bank or Federal savings association must meet the following minimum standards to the satisfaction of the OCC:</P>
          <P>(i) The national bank's or Federal savings association's own estimate of alpha must capture in the numerator the effects of:</P>
          <P>(A) The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of fair values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across counterparties;</P>
          <P>(B) Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</P>

          <P>(C) The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a concentration <PRTPAGE P="140"/>in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is driven by a particular risk factor).</P>
          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</P>
          <P>(iii) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</P>
          <P>(iv) The national bank or Federal savings association must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Risk-based capital requirements for transactions with specific wrong-way risk.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must determine if a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, bond option, or equity derivative contract or purchased credit derivative to which the national bank or Federal savings association applies the internal models methodology under this paragraph (d) has specific wrong-way risk. If a transaction has specific wrong-way risk, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the transaction as its own netting set and exclude it from the model described in § 3.132(d)(2) and instead calculate the risk-based capital requirement for the transaction as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) For an equity derivative contract, by multiplying:</P>
          <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
          <P>(B) The maximum amount the national bank or Federal savings association could lose on the equity derivative.</P>
          <P>(ii) For a purchased credit derivative by multiplying:</P>
          <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
          <P>(B) The fair value of the reference asset of the credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(iii) For a bond option, by multiplying:</P>
          <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
          <P>(B) The smaller of the notional amount of the underlying reference asset and the maximum potential loss under the bond option contract.</P>
          <P>(iv) For a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan by multiplying:</P>
          <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>

          <P>(B) The EAD of the transaction determined according to the EAD equation in § 3.132(b)(2), substituting the estimated value of the collateral assuming a default of the counterparty for the value of the collateral in Σ<E T="03">c</E> of the equation.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">Risk-weighted asset amount for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk.</E> The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk is the sum of a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for purchased credit derivatives that are not bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for equity derivatives with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of this section, and a national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iv) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.</P>
          <P>(9) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures.</E> (i) The national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each <PRTPAGE P="141"/>counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD<E T="52">unstressed</E> of the netting set to obtain the unstressed capital requirement for each netting set. A national bank or Federal savings association that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(3) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the unstressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K<E T="52">unstressed</E>.</P>

          <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each wholesale obligor and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD<E T="52">stressed</E> of the netting set to obtain the stressed capital requirement for each netting set. A national bank or Federal savings association that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(6) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the stressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K<E T="52">stressed</E>.</P>

The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure used for EAD. With respect to paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section:</P>
          <P>(A) For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products, the national bank or Federal savings association may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section for a period not to exceed 180 days.</P>
          <P>(B) For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the national bank or Federal savings association generally may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) To calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of the approach in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 3.131, multiply the output of the formula by the EAD for the exposure as specified above, and multiply by 12.5.</P>

A national bank or Federal savings association that receives prior OCC approval to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amounts for a class of counterparties using the advanced CVA approach must continue to use that approach for that class of counterparties until it notifies the OCC in writing that the national bank or Federal savings association expects to begin calculating its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach. Such notice must include an <PRTPAGE P="142"/>explanation of the national bank's or Federal savings association's rationale and the date upon which the national bank or Federal savings association will begin to calculate its CVA risk-weighted asset amount using the simple CVA approach.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This section applies to wholesale exposures for which:</P>
          <P>(i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the national bank or Federal savings association and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(2) Wholesale exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) are securitization exposures subject to §§ 3.141 through 3.145.</P>
          <P>(3) A national bank or Federal savings association may elect to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covering an exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by using the PD substitution approach or the LGD adjustment approach in paragraph (c) of this section or, if the transaction qualifies, using the double default treatment in § 3.135. A national bank's or Federal savings association's PD and LGD for the hedged exposure may not be lower than the PD and LGD floors described in § 3.131(d)(2) and (d)(3).</P>
          <P>(4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged wholesale exposures described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(6) A national bank or Federal savings association must use the same risk parameters for calculating ECL as it uses for calculating the risk-based capital requirement for the exposure.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules of recognition.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.</P>

          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:<PRTPAGE P="152"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> (that is, equally) with or is junior to the hedged exposure; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are exposures to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to assure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligor fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Risk parameters for hedged exposures</E>—(1) <E T="03">PD substitution approach</E>—(i) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, a national bank or Federal savings association may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure by substituting the PD associated with the rating grade of the protection provider for the PD associated with the rating grade of the obligor in the risk-based capital formula applicable to the guarantee or credit derivative in Table 1 of § 3.131 and using the appropriate LGD as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that full substitution of the protection provider's PD leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the national bank or Federal savings association may substitute a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and P of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(A) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the protection provider's PD, LGD is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and EAD is P. If the national bank or Federal savings association determines that full substitution leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the national bank or Federal savings association may use a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
          <P>(B) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
          <P>(C) The treatment in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is applicable when the credit risk of a wholesale exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis or when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">LGD of hedged exposures.</E> The LGD of a hedged exposure under the PD substitution approach is equal to:</P>
          <P>(A) The lower of the LGD of the hedged exposure (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative) and the LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative provides the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection; or</P>
          <P>(B) The LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative does not provide the national bank or Federal savings association with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">LGD adjustment approach</E>—(i) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-<PRTPAGE P="153"/>based capital requirement for the hedged exposure is the greater of:</P>
          <P>(A) The risk-based capital requirement for the exposure as calculated under § 3.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative; or</P>
          <P>(B) The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the protection provider as calculated under § 3.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
          <P>(A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure would be the greater of:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure as calculated under § 3.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative and EAD set equal to P; or</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the guarantor as calculated under § 3.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD set equal to P.</P>
          <P>(B) The national bank or Federal savings association must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 3.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">M of hedged exposures.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the M of the hedged exposure is the same as the M of the exposure if it were unhedged.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining its risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
          <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
          <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the national bank or Federal savings association (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the national bank or Federal savings association to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.<SU>30</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>30</SU> For example, where there is a step-up in cost in conjunction with a call feature or where the effective cost of protection increases over time even if credit quality remains the same or improves, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant will be the remaining time to the first call.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</P>

          <P>(5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the national bank or Federal savings association must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant:

          <P>(1) The hedged exposure is fully covered or covered on a pro rata basis by:</P>
          <P>(i) An eligible guarantee issued by an eligible double default guarantor; or</P>

          <P>(3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</P>
          <P>(4) The positive current exposure of a national bank or Federal savings association for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the national bank or Federal savings association to the counterparty.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</P>
          <P>(1) Cleared transactions that are subject to daily marking-to-market and daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</P>
          <P>(2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions (which are addressed in §§ 3.131 and 132);</P>

A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
          <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the national bank's or Federal savings association's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
          <P>(2) The national bank or Federal savings association has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
          <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
          <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>

A national bank or Federal savings association that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A national bank or Federal savings association that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must hold risk-based capital under this subpart against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
          <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
          <P>(i) Financial collateral; or</P>

          <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the national bank or Federal savings association in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
          <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the national bank or Federal savings association after the inception of the securitization;</P>
          <P>(3) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>

          <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures that are not equity exposures to investment funds, a national bank or Federal savings association may apply either the Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA) in § 3.152 or, if it qualifies to do so, the Internal Models Approach (IMA) in § 3.153. A national bank or Federal savings association must use the look-through approaches provided in § 3.154 to calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures to investment funds.</P>
          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 3.2), as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund as provided in § 3.154.</P>

          <P>(B) The beneficiary of the contract an amount equal to the shortfall between the fair value and book value of a specified portfolio of assets.<PRTPAGE P="171"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association that purchases stable value protection on its investment in a separate account must treat the portion of the carrying value of its investment in the separate account attributable to the stable value protection as an exposure to the provider of the protection and the remaining portion of the carrying value of its separate account as an equity exposure to an investment fund.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Under the SRWA, a national bank's or Federal savings association's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures (other than equity exposures to an investment fund) as determined in this section and the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the national bank's or Federal savings association's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as determined in § 3.154.</P>

          <P>(i) <E T="03">Community development equity exposures.</E> An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.</P>

          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-significant equity exposures.</E> Equity exposures, excluding significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated institution in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the OCC's application of <PRTPAGE P="172"/>paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the national bank's or Federal savings association's total capital.</P>
          <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a national bank or Federal savings association does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</P>
          <P>(B) When determining which of a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposures qualifies for a 100 percent risk weight under this section, a national bank or Federal savings association first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">250 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock that are not deducted from capital pursuant to § 3.22(b)(4) are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">300 percent risk weight equity exposures.</E> A publicly traded equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge pair) is assigned a 300 percent risk weight.</P>

          <P>(i) Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not for the OCC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in § 3.2; and</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Hedge transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Hedge pair.</E> A hedge pair is two equity exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly traded equity exposure.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective hedge.</E> Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the national bank or Federal savings association acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the national bank or Federal savings association will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A national bank or Federal savings association must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E:</P>

          <P>(i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the national bank or Federal savings association <PRTPAGE P="173"/>must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals zero. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.</P>

However, if the estimated regression coefficient is positive, then the value of E is zero.</P>

          <P>(1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have one or more models that:</P>

          <P>(3) The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the national bank's or Federal savings association's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the national bank's or Federal savings association's estimates.</P>
          <P>(4) The national bank's or Federal savings association's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the national bank's or Federal savings association's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the national bank's or Federal savings association's model uses a scenario methodology, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the national bank or Federal savings association employs risk factor models, the national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.</P>
          <P>(5) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures and that the national bank or Federal savings association has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The national bank or Federal savings association must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled equity exposures.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Available approaches.</E> (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.152(b)(3)(i), a national bank or Federal savings association must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alternative modified look-through approach in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 3.152(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.</P>
          <P>(3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the national bank or Federal savings association does not use the full look-through approach, the national bank or Federal savings association may use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 3.152(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Full look-through approach.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart E of this part as if the proportional ownership share of each exposure were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association) may either:</P>
          <P>(1) Set the risk-weighted asset amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</P>
          <P>(i) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the national bank or Federal savings association; and</P>

          <P>(2) Include the national bank's or Federal savings association's proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the fund in the national bank's or Federal savings association's IMA.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Simple modified look-through approach.</E> Under this approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight assigned according to subpart D of this part that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under its prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under this approach, a national bank or Federal savings association may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories assigned according to subpart D of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the national bank's or Federal savings association's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the national bank or Federal savings association must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the national bank or Federal savings association must use the highest applicable risk weight. A national bank or Federal savings association may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

          <P>(a) Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an equity derivative contract under this part, a national bank or Federal savings association must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk-weighted asset amount for the contract under § 3.132.</P>
          <P>(b) Under the SRWA, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a national bank or Federal savings association using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has <PRTPAGE P="178"/>received notification from the OCC pursuant to section 121(d) of subpart E of this part must publicly disclose each quarter its total and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and their components as calculated under this subpart (that is, common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, total qualifying capital, and total risk-weighted assets).</P>
          <P>(b) A national bank or Federal savings association that is an advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association that has completed the parallel run process and that has received notification from the OCC pursuant to section 121(d) of subpart E of this part must comply with paragraph (c) of this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) A national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 3.173. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes to these are disclosed in the interim. Management may provide all of the disclosures required by this subpart in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
          <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
          <P>(3) If a national bank or Federal savings association described in paragraph (b) of this section believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose those specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>
          <P>(d)(1) A national bank or Federal savings association that meets any of the criteria in § 3.100(b)(1) before January 1, 2015, must publicly disclose each quarter its supplementary leverage ratio and the components thereof (that is, tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure) as calculated under subpart B of this part, beginning with the first quarter in 2015. This disclosure requirement applies without regard to whether the national bank or Federal savings association has completed the parallel run process and received notification from the OCC pursuant to § 3.121(d).</P>

This should be done for each of the four category/subcategories. The national bank or Federal savings association must disclose any significant differences in approach to estimating these variables within each category/subcategories.</TNOTE>

Disclosure of each PD grade should include the exposure-weighted average PD for each grade.

The disclosures are requirements from year-end 2010; in the meantime, early adoption is encouraged.

            <TNOTE>
              <SU>5</SU> This disclosure item is not intended to be prescriptive about the period used for this assessment. Upon implementation, it is expected that a national bank or Federal savings association would provide these disclosures for as long a set of data as possible—for example, if a national bank or Federal savings association has 10 years of data, it might choose to disclose the average default rates for each PD grade over that 10-year period. Annual amounts need not be disclosed.</TNOTE>

              <SU>6</SU> A national bank or Federal savings association must provide this further decomposition where it will allow users greater insight into the reliability of the estimates provided in the “quantitative disclosures: Risk assessment.” In particular, it must provide this information where there are material differences between its estimates of PD, LGD or EAD compared to actual outcomes over the long run. The national bank or Federal savings association must also provide explanations for such differences.</TNOTE>

        <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, and reservation of authority.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart F establishes risk-based capital requirements for national banks or Federal savings associations with significant exposure to market risk, provides methods for these national banks or Federal savings associations to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public disclosure requirements.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart F applies to any national bank or Federal savings association with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the national bank's or <PRTPAGE P="188"/>Federal savings association's most recent quarterly [regulatory report]), equal to:</P>
        <P>(i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly [Call Report or FR Y-9C]; or</P>
        <P>(ii) $1 billion or more.</P>
        <P>(2) The OCC may apply this subpart to any national bank or Federal savings association if the OCC deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the national bank or Federal savings association or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.</P>
        <P>(3) The OCC may exclude a national bank or Federal savings association that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this subpart if the OCC determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the national bank or Federal savings association and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority</E> (1) The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this subpart if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this subpart is not commensurate with the market risk of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in 12 CFR 3.404.</P>
        <P>(2) If the OCC determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this subpart by the national bank or Federal savings association for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the OCC may require the national bank or Federal savings association to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.</P>
        <P>(3) The OCC may also require a national bank or Federal savings association to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.</P>
        <P>(4) Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Requirements for application of this subpart F.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Trading positions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Identification of trading positions.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which of its trading assets and trading liabilities are trading positions and which of its trading positions are correlation trading positions. These policies and procedures must take into account:</P>
        <P>(i) The extent to which a position, or a hedge of its material risks, can be marked-to-market daily by reference to a two-way market; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Possible impairments to the liquidity of a position or its hedge.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Trading and hedging strategies.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined trading and hedging strategies for its trading positions that are approved by senior management of the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>
        <P>(i) The trading strategy must articulate the expected holding period of, and the market risk associated with, each portfolio of trading positions.</P>
        <P>(ii) The hedging strategy must articulate for each portfolio of trading positions the level of market risk the national bank or Federal savings association is willing to accept and must detail the instruments, techniques, and strategies the national bank or Federal savings association will use to hedge the risk of the portfolio.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Management of covered positions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Active management.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must have clearly defined policies and procedures for actively managing all covered positions. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must require:</P>
        <P>(i) Marking positions to market or to model on a daily basis;</P>
        <P>(ii) Daily assessment of the national bank's or Federal savings association's ability to hedge position and portfolio risks, and of the extent of market liquidity;</P>
        <P>(iii) Establishment and daily monitoring of limits on positions by a risk control unit independent of the trading business unit;</P>

        <P>(iv) Daily monitoring by senior management of information described in <PRTPAGE P="192"/>paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section;</P>
        <P>(v) At least annual reassessment of established limits on positions by senior management; and</P>
        <P>(vi) At least annual assessments by qualified personnel of the quality of market inputs to the valuation process, the soundness of key assumptions, the reliability of parameter estimation in pricing models, and the stability and accuracy of model calibration under alternative market scenarios.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Valuation of covered positions.</E> The national bank or Federal savings association must have a process for prudent valuation of its covered positions that includes policies and procedures on the valuation of positions, marking positions to market or to model, independent price verification, and valuation adjustments or reserves. The valuation process must consider, as appropriate, unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, early termination costs, investing and funding costs, liquidity, and model risk.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for internal models.</E> (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before using any internal model to calculate its risk-based capital requirement under this subpart.</P>
        <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association must meet all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis. The national bank or Federal savings association must promptly notify the OCC when:</P>
        <P>(i) The national bank or Federal savings association plans to extend the use of a model that the OCC has approved under this subpart to an additional business line or product type;</P>
        <P>(ii) The national bank or Federal savings association makes any change to an internal model approved by the OCC under this subpart that would result in a material change in the national bank's or Federal savings association's risk-weighted asset amount for a portfolio of covered positions; or</P>
        <P>(iii) The national bank or Federal savings association makes any material change to its modeling assumptions.</P>
        <P>(3) The OCC may rescind its approval of the use of any internal model (in whole or in part) or of the determination of the approach under § 3.209(a)(2)(ii) for a national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled correlation trading positions and determine an appropriate capital requirement for the covered positions to which the model would apply, if the OCC determines that the model no longer complies with this subpart or fails to reflect accurately the risks of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions.</P>
        <P>(4) The national bank or Federal savings association must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its internal models in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance those models as appropriate to ensure that they continue to meet the OCC's standards for model approval and employ risk measurement methodologies that are most appropriate for the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions.</P>
        <P>(5) The national bank or Federal savings association must incorporate its internal models into its risk management process and integrate the internal models used for calculating its VaR-based measure into its daily risk management process.</P>
        <P>(6) The level of sophistication of a national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must be commensurate with the complexity and amount of its covered positions. A national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models may use any of the generally accepted approaches, including but not limited to variance-covariance models, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations, to measure market risk.</P>
        <P>(7) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must properly measure all the material risks in the covered positions to which they are applied.</P>
        <P>(8) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models must conservatively assess the risks arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios.</P>

        <P>(9) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a rigorous <PRTPAGE P="193"/>and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal models to ensure continued applicability and relevance.</P>
        <P>(10) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal models to measure specific risk, the internal models must also satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of § 3.207.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The national bank or Federal savings association must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>
        <P>(2) The national bank or Federal savings association must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The national bank's or Federal savings association's validation process must be independent of the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:</P>
        <P>(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the internal models;</P>
        <P>(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and the comparison of the national bank's or Federal savings association's model outputs with relevant internal and external data sources or estimation techniques; and</P>
        <P>(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting. For internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this process must include a comparison of the changes in the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio value that would have occurred were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with VaR-based measures during a sample period not used in model development.</P>
        <P>(3) The national bank or Federal savings association must stress test the market risk of its covered positions at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, and in no case less frequently than quarterly. The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the national bank's or Federal savings association's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.</P>
        <P>(4) The national bank or Federal savings association must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the national bank's or Federal savings association's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the national bank's or Federal savings association's measures for market risk under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the national bank's or Federal savings association's board of directors (or a committee thereof).</P>

        <SUBJECT>VaR-based measure.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of § 3.207. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the national bank's or Federal savings association's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under § 3.209. A national bank or Federal savings association may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.</P>
        <P>(1) The national bank's or Federal savings association's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve—in no case less than six—to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
        <P>(2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the national bank or Federal savings association validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the national bank or Federal savings association must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.</P>

        <P>(3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the fair value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. A <PRTPAGE P="196"/>national bank or Federal savings association with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.</P>
        <P>(4) The national bank or Federal savings association must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the OCC the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its VaR-based measure that the national bank or Federal savings association uses in its pricing models.</P>
        <P>(5) The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual positions for which such proxies are used.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure.</E> (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the national bank or Federal savings association may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. A national bank or Federal savings association that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the OCC.</P>
        <P>(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the national bank's or Federal savings association's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The national bank or Federal savings association must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For a national bank or Federal savings association that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the national bank or Federal savings association must either:</P>
        <P>(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Demonstrate to the OCC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the national bank's or Federal savings association's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A national bank or Federal savings association using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.</P>
        <P>(c) A national bank or Federal savings association must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the OCC for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the national bank or Federal savings association and the OCC to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the OCC will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the national bank's or Federal savings association's covered positions. The national bank or Federal savings association must retain and make available to the OCC the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:</P>
        <P>(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;</P>
        <P>(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and</P>
        <P>(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>

The national bank or Federal savings association must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the national bank or Federal savings association makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:</P>
        <P>(i) How the national bank or Federal savings association links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's process for selecting, reviewing, and updating the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and for monitoring the appropriateness of the period to the national bank's or Federal savings association's current portfolio.</P>

        <P>(b) <E T="03">Modeled specific risk.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association may use models to measure the specific risk of covered positions as provided in paragraph (a) of section 205 of this subpart (therefore, excluding securitization positions that are not modeled under section 209 of this subpart). A national bank or Federal savings association must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under § 3.209.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements for specific risk modeling.</E> (i) If a national bank or Federal savings association uses internal models to measure the specific risk of a portfolio, the internal models must:</P>
        <P>(A) Explain the historical price variation in the portfolio;</P>
        <P>(B) Be responsive to changes in market conditions;</P>
        <P>(C) Be robust to an adverse environment, including signaling rising risk in an adverse environment; and</P>
        <P>(D) Capture all material components of specific risk for the debt and equity positions in the portfolio. Specifically, the internal models must:</P>

        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to material differences between positions that are similar but not identical and to changes in portfolio composition and concentrations.</P>

        <P>(ii) If a national bank or Federal savings association calculates an incremental risk measure for a portfolio of debt or equity positions under section 208 of this subpart, the national bank or Federal savings association is not <PRTPAGE P="198"/>required to capture default and credit migration risks in its internal models used to measure the specific risk of those portfolios.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Incremental risk.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under § 3.207(b) using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the national bank's or Federal savings association's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the national bank or Federal savings association internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. A national bank or Federal savings association may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for incremental risk modeling.</E> For purposes of calculating the incremental risk measure, the incremental risk model must:</P>
        <P>(1) Measure incremental risk over a one-year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.</P>
        <P>(i) A constant level of risk assumption means that the national bank or Federal savings association rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions at the beginning of each liquidity horizon over the one-year horizon in a manner that maintains the national bank's or Federal savings association's initial risk level. The national bank or Federal savings association must determine the frequency of rebalancing in a manner consistent with the liquidity horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a national bank or Federal savings association to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.</P>
        <P>(ii) A constant position assumption means that the national bank or Federal savings association maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon. If a national bank or Federal savings association uses this assumption, it must do so consistently across all portfolios.</P>

        <P>(iii) A national bank's or Federal savings association's selection of a constant position or a constant risk assumption must be consistent between <PRTPAGE P="199"/>the national bank's or Federal savings association's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209 of this subpart, if applicable.</P>
        <P>(iv) A national bank's or Federal savings association's treatment of liquidity horizons must be consistent between the national bank's or Federal savings association's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209, if applicable.</P>
        <P>(2) Recognize the impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors.</P>
        <P>(3) Reflect the effect of issuer and market concentrations, as well as concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed conditions.</P>
        <P>(4) Reflect netting only of long and short positions that reference the same financial instrument.</P>
        <P>(5) Reflect any material mismatch between a position and its hedge.</P>
        <P>(6) Recognize the effect that liquidity horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. In such cases, a national bank or Federal savings association must:</P>
        <P>(i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>
        <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</P>
        <P>(iii) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</P>
        <P>(iv) Capture in the incremental risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies.</P>
        <P>(7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behavior with respect to default and migration changes.</P>
        <P>(8) Maintain consistency with the national bank's or Federal savings association's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing risk.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of incremental risk capital requirement.</E> The incremental risk capital requirement is the greater of:</P>

        <P>(2) A national bank or Federal savings association that measures the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions using internal models must calculate at least weekly a comprehensive risk measure that captures all price risk according to the requirements of this section. The comprehensive risk measure is either:</P>
        <P>(i) The sum of:</P>

        <P>(A) The national bank's or Federal savings association's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(B) The total specific risk add-on that would apply to the bank's modeled correlation trading positions as calculated under section 210 of this subpart multiplied by 8.0 percent.</P>

        <P>(2) The model must capture all material price risk, including but not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The risks associated with the contractual structure of cash flows of the position, its issuer, and its underlying exposures;</P>
        <P>(ii) Credit spread risk, including nonlinear price risks;</P>

        <P>(iv) Basis risk;</P>
        <P>(v) Recovery rate volatility as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; and</P>
        <P>(vi) To the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates the benefits of dynamic hedging, the static nature of the hedge over the liquidity horizon must be recognized. In such cases, a national bank or Federal savings association must:</P>
        <P>(A) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>
        <P>(B) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</P>

        <P>(D) Capture in the comprehensive risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies;</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 3.210</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Standardized measurement method for specific risk</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the national bank's or Federal savings association's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under § 3.209. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in <PRTPAGE P="201"/>this subpart, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position in § 3.202, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this section 210 of this subpart.</P>
        <P>(1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current fair value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.</P>
        <P>(2) For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the national bank or Federal savings association directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, a national bank or Federal savings association must risk weight the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.</P>
        <P>(3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, a national bank or Federal savings association may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. A national bank or Federal savings association may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association includes the costs of conversion.</P>
        <P>(4) A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:</P>
        <P>(i) The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in fair value of the debt or securitization position);</P>
        <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;</P>
        <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and</P>
        <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.</P>
        <P>(5) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:</P>
        <P>(i) The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;</P>
        <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;</P>
        <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position; and</P>

        <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in the case where the credit derivative hedge has a standard maturity date:<PRTPAGE P="202"/>
        </P>
        <P>(A) The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or</P>
        <P>(B) For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.</P>
        <P>(6) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Debt and securitization positions.</E> (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, a national bank or Federal savings association must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) For the purpose of this section, the appropriate specific risk-weighting factors include:</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Sovereign debt positions.</E> (A) In accordance with Table 1 to § 3.210, a national bank or Federal savings association must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to a sovereign debt position based on the CRC applicable to the sovereign, and, as applicable, the remaining contractual maturity of the position, or if there is no CRC applicable to the sovereign, based on whether the sovereign entity is a member of the OECD. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, sovereign debt positions that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States are treated as having a CRC of 0.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a national bank or Federal savings association must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a national bank or Federal savings association must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
        <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
        <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
        <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
        <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
        <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
        <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
        <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
        <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
        <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>

        <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Except as provided in § 3.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the national bank or Federal savings association to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the national bank's or Federal <PRTPAGE P="209"/>savings association's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

        <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 3.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n<E T="51">th</E>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
        <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.</P>

        <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.</P>

        <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization position is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average of 1.00 and K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For the purpose of this calculation:</P>

        <SUBJECT>Market risk disclosures.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> A national bank or Federal savings association must comply with this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a depository institution that is subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. A national bank or Federal savings association must make timely public disclosures each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a national bank or Federal savings association believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the national bank or Federal savings association is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed. The national bank's or Federal <PRTPAGE P="211"/>savings association's management may provide all of the disclosures required by this section in one place on the national bank's or Federal savings association's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure policy.</E> The national bank or Federal savings association must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses the national bank's or Federal savings association's approach for determining its market risk disclosures. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. One or more senior officers of the national bank or Federal savings association must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart, and the board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Quantitative disclosures.</E> (1) For each material portfolio of covered positions, the national bank or Federal savings association must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least quarterly:</P>

        <P>(ii) The high, low, and mean stressed VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the stressed VaR-based measure at period-end;</P>
        <P>(iii) The high, low, and mean incremental risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the incremental risk capital requirement at period-end;</P>
        <P>(iv) The high, low, and mean comprehensive risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the comprehensive risk capital requirement at period-end, with the period-end requirement broken down into appropriate risk classifications (for example, default risk, migration risk, correlation risk);</P>
        <P>(v) Separate measures for interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk used to calculate the VaR-based measure; and</P>

        <P>(ii) The aggregate amount of correlation trading positions.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualitative disclosures.</E> For each material portfolio of covered positions, the national bank or Federal savings association must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, or more frequently in the event of material changes for each portfolio:</P>
        <P>(1) The composition of material portfolios of covered positions;</P>
        <P>(2) The national bank's or Federal savings association's valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for covered positions including, for securitization positions, the methods and key assumptions used for valuing such positions, any significant changes since the last reporting period, and the impact of such change;</P>
        <P>(3) The characteristics of the internal models used for purposes of this subpart. For the incremental risk capital requirement and the comprehensive risk capital requirement, this must include:</P>
        <P>(i) The approach used by the national bank or Federal savings association to determine liquidity horizons;</P>

        <P>(ii) The methodologies used to achieve a capital assessment that is <PRTPAGE P="212"/>consistent with the required soundness standard; and</P>

        <P>The rules and procedures specified in this subpart are applicable to a proceeding to establish required minimum capital ratios that would otherwise be applicable to a national bank or Federal savings association under subpart B of this part. The OCC is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s)(2) and 3907(a)(2) to establish such minimum capital requirements for a national bank or Federal savings association as the OCC, in its discretion, deems appropriate in light of the particular circumstances at that national bank or Federal savings association. Proceedings under this subpart also may be initiated to require a national bank or Federal savings association having capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part, or other legal authority to continue to maintain those higher ratios.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
        <P>The OCC may require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual national bank or Federal savings association in view of its circumstances. For example, higher capital ratios may be appropriate for:</P>
        <P>(a) A newly chartered national bank or Federal savings association;</P>
        <P>(b) A national bank or Federal savings association receiving special supervisory attention;</P>
        <P>(c) A national bank or Federal savings association that has, or is expected to have, losses resulting in capital inadequacy;</P>
        <P>(d) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure due to the risks from concentrations of credit, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, or management's overall inability to monitor and control financial and operating risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities;</P>
        <P>(e) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates;</P>
        <P>(f) A national bank or Federal savings association with significant exposure due to fiduciary or operational risk;</P>
        <P>(g) A national bank or Federal savings association exposed to a high degree of asset depreciation, or a low level of liquid assets in relation to short term liabilities;</P>
        <P>(h) A national bank or Federal savings association exposed to a high volume of, or particularly severe, problem loans;</P>
        <P>(i) A national bank or Federal savings association that is growing rapidly, either internally or through acquisitions; or</P>
        <P>(j) A national bank or Federal savings association that may be adversely affected by the activities or condition of its holding company, affiliate(s), or other persons or institutions, including chain banking organizations, with which it has significant business relationships.</P>

        <P>The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual national bank or Federal savings association cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:</P>
        <P>(a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the OCC's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are appropriate or necessary for the national bank or Federal savings association;</P>
        <P>(b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;</P>

        <P>(c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the national bank or Federal savings association and, if applicable, its holding company and/or affiliate(s);<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
        </P>
        <P>(d) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity, capital, risk asset and other ratios compared to the ratios of its peer group; and</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice.</E> When the OCC determines that minimum capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part or other legal authority are necessary or appropriate for a particular national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC will notify the national bank or Federal savings association in writing of the proposed minimum capital ratios and the date by which they should be reached (if applicable) and will provide an explanation of why the ratios proposed are considered necessary or appropriate for the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Response.</E> (1) The national bank or Federal savings association may respond to any or all of the items in the notice. The response should include any matters which the national bank or Federal savings association would have the OCC consider in deciding whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association, what those capital ratios should be, and, if applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated OCC official within 30 days after the date on which the national bank or Federal savings association received the notice. The OCC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the OCC, the condition of the national bank or Federal savings association so requires, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association is informed promptly of the new time period, or with the consent of the national bank or Federal savings association. In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.</P>
        <P>(2) Failure to respond within 30 days or such other time period as may be specified by the OCC shall constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed minimum capital ratios or the deadline for their achievement.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision.</E> After the close of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response period, the OCC will decide, based on a review of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response and other information concerning the national bank or Federal savings association, whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association and, if so, the ratios and the date the requirements will become effective. The national bank or Federal savings association will be notified of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision, except for a decision not to establish individual minimum capital requirements for the national bank or Federal savings association.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of plan.</E> The decision may require the national bank or Federal savings association to develop and submit to the OCC, within a time period specified, an acceptable plan to reach the minimum capital ratios established for the national bank or Federal savings association by the date required.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Change in circumstances.</E> If, after the OCC's decision in paragraph (c) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required minimum capital ratios by the specified date, the national bank or Federal savings association may propose to the OCC, or the OCC may propose to the national bank or Federal savings association, a change in the minimum capital ratios for the national bank or Federal savings association, the date when the minimums must be achieved, or the national bank's or Federal savings association's plan (if applicable). The OCC may decline to consider proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the OCC's original decision and any plan required under that decision shall continue in full force and effect.</P>

A directive is an order issued to a national bank or Federal savings association that does not have or maintain capital at or above the minimum ratios set forth in subpart B of this part, or established for the national bank or Federal savings association under subpart H of this part, by a written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), or as a condition for approval of an application. A directive may order the national bank or Federal savings association to:</P>
        <P>(1) Achieve the minimum capital ratios applicable to it by a specified date;</P>
        <P>(2) Adhere to a previously submitted plan to achieve the applicable capital ratios;</P>
        <P>(3) Submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the OCC describing the means and time schedule by which the national bank or Federal savings association shall achieve the applicable capital ratios;</P>
        <P>(4) Take other action, such as reduction of assets or the rate of growth of assets, or restrictions on the payment of dividends, to achieve the applicable capital ratios; or</P>
        <P>(5) A combination of any of these or similar actions.</P>
        <P>(b) A directive issued under this rule, including a plan submitted under a directive, is enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order which has become final as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1818(k). Violation of a directive may result in assessment of civil money penalties in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).</P>

        <P>(3) When the national bank or Federal savings association already has advised the OCC that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital ratios.</P>
        <P>(b) In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.</P>

      <APPENDIX>
        <EAR>Pt. 3, App. A</EAR>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 3—Risk-Based Capital Guidelines</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1. Purpose, Applicability of Guidelines, and Definitions.</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) An important function of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (<E T="03">OCC</E>) is to evaluate the adequacy of capital maintained by each national bank. Such an evaluation involves the consideration of numerous factors, including the riskiness of a bank's assets and off-balance sheet items. This appendix A implements the OCC's risk-based capital guidelines. The risk-based capital ratio derived from those guidelines is more systematically sensitive to the credit risk associated with various bank activities than is a capital ratio based strictly on a bank's total balance sheet assets. A bank's risk-based capital ratio is obtained by dividing its capital base (as defined in section 2 of this appendix A) by its risk-weighted assets (as calculated pursuant to section 3 of this appendix A). These guidelines were created within the framework established by the report issued by the Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in July 1988. The OCC believes that the risk-based capital ratio is a useful tool in evaluating the capital adequacy of all national banks, not just those that are active in the international banking system.</P>
        <P>(2) The purpose of this appendix A is to explain precisely (i) how a national bank's risk-based capital ratio is determined and (ii) how these risk-based capital guidelines are applied to national banks. The OCC will review these guidelines periodically for possible adjustments commensurate with its experience with the risk-based capital ratio and with changes in the economy, financial markets and domestic and international banking practices.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) The risk-based capital ratio derived from these guidelines is an important factor in the OCC's evaluation of a bank's capital adequacy. However, since this measure addresses only credit risk, the 8% minimum ratio should not be viewed as the level to be targeted, but rather as a floor. The final supervisory judgment on a bank's capital adequacy is based on an individualized assessment of numerous factors, including those listed in 12 CFR 3.10. With respect to the consideration of these factors, the OCC will give particular attention to any bank with significant exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates. As a result, it may differ from the conclusion drawn from an isolated comparison of a bank's risk-based capital ration to the 8% minimum specified in these guidelines. In addition to the standards established by these risk-based capital guidelines, all national banks must maintain a minimum capital-to-total assets ratio in <PRTPAGE P="224"/>accordance with the provisions of 12 CFR part 3.</P>
        <P>(2) Effective December 31, 1990, these risk-based capital guidelines will apply to all national banks. In the interim, banks must maintain minimum capital-to-total assets ratios as required by 12 CFR part 3, and should begin preparing for the implementation of these risk-based capital guidelines. In this regard, each national bank that does not currently meet the final minimum ratio established in section 4(b)(1) of this appendix A should begin planning for achieving that standard.</P>
        <P>(3) These risk-based capital guidelines will not be applied to federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this appendix A, the following definitions apply:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Adjusted carrying value</E> means, for purposes of section 2(c)(5) of this appendix A, the aggregate value that investments are carried on the balance sheet of the bank reduced by any unrealized gains on the investments that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the bank's Tier 1 capital and reduced by any associated deferred tax liabilities. For example, for investments held as available-for-sale (AFS), the adjusted carrying value of the investments would be the aggregate carrying value of the investments (as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the bank) less any unrealized gains on those investments that are included in other comprehensive income and that are not reflected in Tier 1 capital, and less any associated deferred tax liabilities. Unrealized losses on AFS nonfinancial equity investments must be deducted from Tier 1 capital in accordance with section 1(c)(10) of this appendix A. The treatment of small business investment companies that are consolidated for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is discussed in section 2(c)(5)(ii) of this appendix A. For investments in a nonfinancial company that is consolidated for accounting purposes, the bank's adjusted carrying value of the investment is determined under the equity method of accounting (net of any intangibles associated with the investment that are deducted from the bank's Tier 1 capital in accordance with section 2(c)(2) of this appendix A). Even though the assets of the nonfinancial company are consolidated for accounting purposes, these assets (as well as the credit equivalent amounts of the company's off-balance sheet items) are excluded from the bank's risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Allowances for loan and lease losses</E> means the balance of the valuation reserve on December 31, 1968, plus additions to the reserve charged to operations since that date, less losses charged against the allowance net of recoveries.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Asset-backed commercial paper program</E> means a program that primarily issues externally rated commercial paper backed by assets or other exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Asset-backed commercial paper sponsor</E> means a bank that:</P>
        <P>(i) Establishes an asset-backed commercial paper program;</P>
        <P>(ii) Approves the sellers permitted to participate in an asset-backed commercial paper program;</P>
        <P>(iii) Approves the asset pools to be purchased by an asset-backed commercial paper program; or</P>
        <P>(iv) Administers the asset-backed commercial paper program by monitoring the assets, arranging for debt placement, compiling monthly reports, or ensuring compliance with the program documents and with the program's credit and investment policy.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Associated company</E> means any corporation, partnership, business trust, joint venture, association or similar organization in which a national bank directly or indirectly holds a 20 to 50 percent ownership interest.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Banking and finance subsidiary</E> means any subsidiary of a national bank that engages in banking- and finance-related activities.</P>
        <P>(7) <E T="03">Cash items in the process of collection</E> means checks or drafts in the process of collection that are drawn on another depository institution, including a central bank, and that are payable immediately upon presentation in the country in which the reporting bank's office that is clearing or collecting the check or draft is located; U.S. Government checks that are drawn on the United States Treasury or any other U.S. Government or Government-sponsored agency and that are payable immediately upon presentation; broker's security drafts and commodity or bill-of-lading drafts payable immediately upon presentation in the United States or the country in which the reporting bank's office that is handling the drafts is located; and unposted debits.</P>
        <P>(8) <E T="03">Central government</E> means the national governing authority of a country; it includes the departments, ministries and agencies of the central government and the central bank. The U.S. Central Bank includes the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The definition of central government does not include the following: State, provincial, or local governments; commercial enterprises owned by the central government, which are entities engaged in activities involving trade, commerce, or profit that are generally conducted or performed in the private sector of the United States economy; and non-central government entities whose obligations are guaranteed by the central government.</P>
        <P>(9) <E T="03">Commitment</E> means any arrangement that obligates a national bank to: (i) Purchase loans or securities; or (ii) extend credit <PRTPAGE P="225"/>in the form of loans or leases, participations in loans or leases, overdraft facilities, revolving credit facilities, home equity lines of credit, liquidity facilities, or similar transactions.</P>
        <P>(10) <E T="03">Common stockholders' equity</E> means common stock, common stock surplus, undivided profits, capital reserves, and adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.</P>
        <P>(11) <E T="03">Conditional guarantee</E> means a contingent obligation of the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country, the validity of which to the beneficiary is dependent upon some affirmative action—<E T="03">e.g.,</E> servicing requirements—on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party.</P>
        <P>(12) <E T="03">Deferred tax assets</E> means the tax consequences attributable to tax carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Tax carryforwards are deductions or credits that cannot be used for tax purposes during the current period, but can be carried forward to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in a future period or periods. Temporary differences are financial events or transactions that are recognized in one period for financial statement purposes, but are recognized in another period or periods for income tax purposes. Deductible temporary differences are temporary differences that result in a reduction of taxable income in a future period or periods.</P>
        <P>(13) <E T="03">Derivative contract</E> means generally a financial contract whose value is derived from the values of one or more underlying assets, reference rates or indexes of asset values.

In the U.S., this definition encompasses all federally insured offices of commercial banks, mutual and stock savings banks, savings or building and loan associations (stock and mutual), cooperative banks, credit unions, and international banking facilities of domestic depository institution. Bank holding companies are excluded from this definition. For the purposes of assigning risk weights, the differentiation between OECD depository institutions and non-OECD depository institutions is based on the country of incorporation. Claims on branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States are to be categorized on the basis of the parent bank's country of incorporation.</P>
        <P>(15) <E T="03">Equity investment</E> means, for purposes of section 1(c)(19) and section 2(c)(5) of this appendix A, any equity instrument including warrants and call options that give the holder the right to purchase an equity instrument, any equity feature of a debt instrument (such as a warrant or call option), and any debt instrument that is convertible into equity. An investment in any other instrument, including subordinated debt or other types of debt instruments, may be treated as an equity investment if the OCC determines that the instrument is the functional equivalent of equity or exposes the bank to essentially the same risks as an equity instrument.</P>
        <P>(16) <E T="03">Exchange rate contracts</E> include: Cross-currency interest rate swaps; forward foreign exchange rate contracts; currency options purchased; and any similar instrument that, in the opinion of the OCC, gives rise to similar risks.</P>

        <P>(19) <E T="03">Interest rate contracts</E> include: Single currency interest rate swaps; basis swaps; forward rate agreements; interest rate options purchased; forward forward deposits accepted; and any similar instrument that, in the opinion of the OCC, gives rise to similar risks, including when-issued securities.</P>
        <P>(20) <E T="03">Liquidity facility</E> means a legally binding commitment to provide liquidity to various types of transactions, structures or programs. A liquidity facility that supports asset-backed commercial paper, in any amount, by lending to, or purchasing assets from any structure, program, or conduit constitutes an <E T="03">asset-backed commercial paper liquidity facility.</E>
        </P>
        <P>(21) <E T="03">Multifamily residential property</E> means any residential property consisting of five or more dwelling units including apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives, and other similar structures primarily for residential use, but not including hospitals, nursing homes, or other similar facilities.</P>

An equity investment made under section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 in a SBIC that is not consolidated with the bank is treated as a nonfinancial equity investment in the manner provided in section 2(c)(5)(ii)(C) of this appendix A. A nonfinancial company is an entity that engages in any activity that has not been determined to be permissible for a bank to conduct directly or to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)).</P>
        <P>(24) The <E T="03">OECD-based group of countries</E> comprises all full members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regardless of entry date, as well as countries that have concluded special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow, <SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/> but excludes any country that has rescheduled its external sovereign debt within the previous five years. These countries are hereinafter referred to as <E T="03">OECD countries.</E> A rescheduling of external sovereign debt generally would include any renegotiation of terms arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to meet its external debt service obligations, but generally would not include renegotiations of debt in the normal course of business, such as a renegotiation to allow the borrower to take advantage of a decline in interest rates or other change in market conditions.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU> As of November 1995, the OECD included the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and Saudi Arabia had concluded special lending arrangements with the IMF associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow.</P>

        <P>(i) The commitment is not subject to extension or renewal and will actually expire on its stated expiration date; or</P>

        <P>(ii) If the commitment is subject to extension or renewal beyond its stated expiration date, the stated expiration date will be deemed the original maturity only if the extension or renewal must be based upon terms and conditions independently negotiated in good faith with the customer at the time of the extension or renewal and upon a new, <E T="03">bona fide</E> credit analysis utilizing current information on financial condition and trends.</P>
        <P>(26) <E T="03">Preferred stock</E> includes the following instruments: (i) <E T="03">Convertible preferred stock,</E> which means preferred stock that is mandatorily convertible into either common or perpetual preferred stock; (ii) <E T="03">Intermediate-term preferred stock,</E> which means preferred stock with an original maturity of at least five years, but less than 20 years; (iii) <E T="03">Long-term preferred stock,</E> which means preferred stock with an original maturity of 20 years or more; and (iv) <E T="03">Perpetual preferred stock,</E> which means preferred stock without a fixed maturity date that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder, and that has no other provisions that will require future redemption of the issue. For purposes of these instruments, preferred stock that can be redeemed at the option of the holder is deemed to have an <E T="03">original maturity</E> of the earliest possible date on which it may be so redeemed.</P>
        <P>(27) <E T="03">Public-sector entities</E> include states, local authorities and governmental subdivisions below the central government level in an OECD country. In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town, or other municipal corporation, a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or municipal corporation.

        <P>(28) <E T="03">Reciprocal holdings of bank capital instruments</E> means cross-holdings or other formal or informal arrangements in which two or more banking organizations swap, exchange, or otherwise agree to hold each other's capital instruments. This definition does not include holdings of capital instruments issued by other banking organizations that were taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted, provided that the reporting national bank has not held such instruments for more than five years or a longer period approved by the OCC.</P>
        <P>(29) <E T="03">Replacement cost</E> means, with respect to interest rate and exchange rate contracts, the loss that would be incurred in the event of a counterparty default, as measured by <PRTPAGE P="227"/>the net cost of replacing the contract at the current market value. If default would result in a theoretical profit, the replacement value is considered to be zero. The mark-to-market process should incorporate changes in both interest rates and counterparty credit quality.</P>
        <P>(30) <E T="03">Residential properties</E> means houses, condominiums, cooperative units, and manufactured homes. This definition does not include boats or motor homes, even if used as a primary residence.</P>

Before calculating the amount of deferred tax assets subject to the limit in section 2(c)(1)(iii) of this appendix A, a bank may eliminate the deferred tax effects of any net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Banks report these net unrealized holding gains and losses in their Call Reports as a separate component of equity capital, but exclude them from the definition of common stockholders' equity for regulatory capital purposes.

            <SU>1</SU> For purposes of calculating the adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments as a percentage of Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of the Tier 1 capital elements net of goodwill and net of all identifiable intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships, but prior to the deduction for disallowed mortgage servicing assets, disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, disallowed purchased credit card relationships, disallowed credit-enhancing interest only strips (both purchased and retained), disallowed deferred tax assets, and nonfinancial equity investments.</TNOTE>
        </GPOTABLE>
        <P>(B) Deductions for nonfinancial equity investments must be applied on a marginal basis to the portions of the adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that fall within the specified ranges of the bank's Tier 1 capital. For example, if the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by a bank equals 20 percent of the Tier 1 capital of the bank, then the amount of the deduction would be 8 percent of the adjusted carrying value of all investments up to 15 percent of the bank's Tier 1 capital, and 12 percent of the adjusted carrying value of all investments equal to, or in excess of, 15 percent of the bank's Tier 1 capital.</P>
        <P>(C) The total adjusted carrying value of any nonfinancial equity investment that is subject to deduction under section 2(c)(5) of this appendix A is excluded from the bank's weighted risk assets for purposes of computing the denominator of the bank's risk-based capital ratio. For example, if 8 percent of the adjusted carrying value of a nonfinancial equity investment is deducted from Tier 1 capital, the entire adjusted carrying value of the investment will be excluded from risk-weighted assets in calculating the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.</P>
        <P>(D) Banks engaged in equity investment activities, including those banks with a high concentration in nonfinancial equity investments (e.g., in excess of 50 percent of Tier 1 capital), will be monitored and may be subject to heightened supervision, as appropriate, by the OCC to ensure that such banks maintain capital levels that are appropriate in light of their equity investment activities, and the OCC may impose a higher capital charge in any case where the circumstances, such as the level of risk of the particular investment or portfolio of investments, the risk management systems of the bank, or other information, indicate that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Small business investment company investments.</E> (A) Notwithstanding section 2(c)(5)(i) of this appendix A, no deduction is required for nonfinancial equity investments that are made by a bank or its subsidiary through a SBIC that is consolidated with the bank, or in a SBIC that is not consolidated with the bank, to the extent that such investments, in the aggregate, do not exceed 15 percent of the Tier 1 capital of the bank. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, any nonfinancial equity investment that is held through or in a SBIC and not deducted from Tier 1 capital will be assigned to the 100 percent risk-weight category and included in the bank's consolidated risk-weighted assets.</P>

        <P>(B) If a bank has an investment in a SBIC that is consolidated for accounting purposes but the SBIC is not wholly owned by the bank, the adjusted carrying value of the bank's nonfinancial equity investments held through the SBIC is equal to the bank's proportionate share of the SBIC's adjusted carrying value of its equity investments in nonfinancial companies. The remainder of the SBIC's adjusted carrying value (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the minority interest holders' proportionate share) is excluded from the risk-weighted assets of the bank.</P>
        <P>(C) If a bank has an investment in a SBIC that is not consolidated for accounting purposes and has current information that identifies the percentage of the SBIC's assets that are equity investments in nonfinancial companies, the bank may reduce the adjusted carrying value of its investment in the SBIC proportionately to reflect the percentage of the adjusted carrying value of the SBIC's assets that are not equity investments in nonfinancial companies. The amount by which the adjusted carrying value of the bank's investment in the SBIC is reduced under this paragraph will be risk weighted at 100 percent and included in the bank's risk-weighted assets.</P>

        <P>(D) To the extent the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments that the bank holds through a consolidated SBIC or in a nonconsolidated SBIC equals or exceeds, in the aggregate, 15 percent of the Tier 1 capital of the bank, the appropriate percentage of such amounts, as set forth in Table A, must be deducted from the bank's Tier 1 capital. In addition, the aggregate adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held through a consolidated SBIC and in a nonconsolidated SBIC <PRTPAGE P="231"/>(including any nonfinancial equity investments for which no deduction is required) must be included in determining, for purposes of Table A the total amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank in relation to its Tier 1 capital.</P>

        <P>(3) Nonfinancial equity investments received by the bank through a stock split or stock dividend on a nonfinancial equity investment made prior to March 13, 2000, provided that the bank provides no consideration for the shares or interests received, and the transaction does not materially increase the bank's proportional interest in the nonfinancial company.</P>
        <P>(4) Nonfinancial equity investments received by the bank through the exercise on or after March 13, 2000, of an option, warrant, or other agreement that provides the bank with the right, but not the obligation, to acquire equity or make an investment in a nonfinancial company, if the option, warrant, or other agreement was acquired by the bank prior to March 13, 2000, and the bank provides no consideration for the nonfinancial equity investments.</P>
        <P>(B) Any excluded nonfinancial equity investments described in section 2(c)(5)(iii)(A) of this appendix A must be included in determining the total amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank in relation to its Tier 1 capital for purposes of Table A. In addition, any excluded nonfinancial equity investments will be risk weighted at 100 percent and included in the bank's risk-weighted assets.</P>

          <FTREF/> is derived by assigning that bank's assets and off-balance sheet items to one of the four risk categories detailed in section 3(a) of this appendix A. Each category has a specific risk weight. Before an off-balance sheet item is assigned a risk weight, it is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount in accordance with section 3(b) of this appendix A. The risk weight assigned to a particular asset or on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determines the percentage of that asset/credit equivalent that is included in the denominator of the bank's risk-based capital ratio. Any asset deducted from a bank's capital in computing the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio is not included as part of the bank's risk-weighted assets.</P>

        </FTNT>

        <P>Some of the assets on a bank's balance sheet may represent an indirect holding of a pool of assets, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> mutual funds, that encompasses more than one risk weight within the pool. In those situations, the bank may assign the asset to the risk category applicable to the highest risk-weighted asset that pool is permitted to hold pursuant to its stated investment objectives in the fund's prospectus. Alternatively, the bank may assign the asset on a pro rata basis to different risk categories according to the investment <PRTPAGE P="232"/>limits in the fund's prospectus. In either case, the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to such a pool is 20%. If a bank assigns the asset on a pro rata basis, and the sum of the investment limits in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100%, the bank must assign the highest pro rata amounts of its total investment to the higher risk category. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of liquidity, the fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly-liquid securities of superior credit quality (that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight), such securities generally will not be taken into account in determining the risk category into which the bank's holding in the overall pool should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of the investment in that fund above the 20% category. However, if a fund engages in any activities that are deemed to be speculative in nature or has any other characteristics that are inconsistent with the preferential risk weighting assigned to the fund's assets, the bank's investment in the fund will be assigned to the 100% risk category. More detail on the treatment of mortgage-backed securities is provided in section 3(a)(3)(vi) of this appendix A.</P>

        <P>(6) <E T="03">Face amount</E> means the notional principal, or face value, amount of an off-balance sheet item; the amortized cost of an asset not held for trading purposes; and the fair value of a trading asset.</P>
        <P>(7) <E T="03">Financial asset</E> means cash or other monetary instrument, evidence of debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that conveys a right to receive or exchange cash or another financial instrument from another party.</P>

        <P>(9) <E T="03">Mortgage servicer cash advance</E> means funds that a residential mortgage servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the loan. A mortgage servicer cash advance is not a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute if:</P>
        <P>(i) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying asset pool; or</P>
        <P>(ii) For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal amount of that loan.</P>
        <P>(10) <E T="03">Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO)</E> means an entity recognized by the Division of Market Regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor Division) (Commission) as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for various purposes, including the Commission's uniform net capital requirements for brokers and dealers.</P>
        <P>(11) <E T="03">Recourse</E> means a bank's retention, in form or in substance, of any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with an asset it has sold that exceeds a <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of that bank's claim on the asset. If a bank has no claim on a sold asset, then the retention <PRTPAGE P="242"/>of any credit risk is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises when a bank transfers assets and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase assets or to absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if a bank provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold. The following are examples of recourse arrangements:</P>
        <P>(i) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on transferred assets;</P>
        <P>(ii) Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under which the bank will be responsible for losses associated with the loans serviced. Mortgage servicer cash advances that meet the conditions of section 4(a)(9)(i) and (ii) of this appendix A, are not recourse arrangements;</P>

        <P>(iii) Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of losses from the underlying assets;</P>
        <P>(iv) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are not already included on the balance sheet;</P>
        <P>(v) Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity of the transferred portion of the loan is shorter than the maturity of the commitment under which the loan is drawn;</P>
        <P>(vi) Credit derivatives issued that absorb more than the bank's pro rata share of losses from the transferred assets;</P>
        <P>(vii) Clean-up calls. Clean-up calls that are 10% or less of the original pool balance and that are exercisable at the option of the bank are not recourse arrangements; and</P>
        <P>(viii) Noneligible asset-backed commercial paper liquidity facilities.</P>
        <P>(12) <E T="03">Residual interest</E> means any on-balance sheet asset that represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of financial assets, whether through a securitization or otherwise, and that exposes a bank to any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred asset that exceeds a <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of that bank's claim on the asset, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques. Residual interests generally include credit-enhancing interest-only strips, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests (and other forms of overcollateralization) and similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the bank to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold. Residual interests generally do not include interests purchased from a third party.</P>
        <P>(13) <E T="03">Risk participation</E> means a participation in which the originating party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of an obligation (<E T="03">e.g.</E> a direct credit substitute) notwithstanding that another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.</P>
        <P>(14) <E T="03">Securitization</E> means the pooling and repackaging by a special purpose entity of assets or other credit exposures that can be sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and commitments.</P>
        <P>(15) <E T="03">Structured finance program</E> means a program where receivable interests and asset-backed securities issued by multiple participants are purchased by a special purpose entity that repackages those exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Structured finance programs allocate credit risks, generally, between the participants and credit enhancement provided to the program.</P>
        <P>(16) <E T="03">Traded position</E> means a position retained, assumed or issued in connection with a securitization that is externally rated, where there is a reasonable expectation that, in the near future, the rating will be relied upon by:</P>
        <P>(i) Unaffiliated investors to purchase the position; or</P>
        <P>(ii) An unaffiliated third party to enter into a transaction involving the position, such as a purchase, loan or repurchase agreement.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Credit equivalent amounts and risk weights of recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Credit-equivalent amount.</E> Except as otherwise provided, the credit-equivalent amount for a recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the bank directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk multiplied by a 100% conversion factor.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk-weight factor.</E> To determine the bank's risk-weighted assets for off-balance sheet recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes, the credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral. For a direct credit substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a purchased subordinated security), a bank must calculate risk-weighted assets using the amount of the direct credit substitute and the full amount of the assets it supports, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> all the more senior positions in the structure.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit equivalent amount and risk weight of participations in, and syndications of, direct credit substitutes.</E> The credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in, or syndication of, a direct credit substitute is calculated and risk weighted as follows:<PRTPAGE P="243"/>
        </P>

        <P>(1) In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a bank has conveyed a risk participation, the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute is converted to a credit equivalent amount using a 100% conversion factor. The <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the credit equivalent amount that has been conveyed through a risk participation is then assigned to whichever risk-weight category is lower: the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral, or the risk-weight category appropriate to the party acquiring the participation. The <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the credit equivalent amount that has not been participated out is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</P>

        <P>(2) In the case of a direct credit substitute in which the bank has acquired a risk participation, the acquiring bank's <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the direct credit substitute is multiplied by the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute and converted using a 100% credit conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</P>

        <P>(3) In the case of a direct credit substitute that takes the form of a syndication where each bank or participating entity is obligated only for its <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating entity, each bank's credit equivalent amount will be calculated by multiplying only its <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the assets supported by the direct credit substitute by a 100% conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Externally rated positions: credit-equivalent amounts and risk weights</E>—(1) <E T="03">Traded positions.</E> With respect to a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest (other than a credit-enhancing interest-only strip) or asset- or mortgage-backed security that is a “traded position” and that has received an external rating on a long-term position that is one grade below investment grade or better or a short-term position that is investment grade, the bank may multiply the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight, determined in accordance with Tables C or D of this appendix A. <SU>24</SU>

        <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-traded positions.</E> A recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest (but not a credit-enhancing interest-only strip) or asset- or mortgage-backed security extended in connection with a securitization that is not a “traded position” may be assigned a risk weight in accordance with section 4(d)(1) of this appendix A if:</P>
        <P>(i) It has been externally rated by more than one NRSRO;</P>
        <P>(ii) It has received an external rating on a long-term position that is one category below investment grade or better or a short-term position that is investment grade by all NRSROs providing a rating;</P>
        <P>(iii) The ratings are publicly available; and</P>

        <P>(iv) The ratings are based on the same criteria used to rate traded positions.
        </P>

        <FP>If the ratings are different, the lowest rating will determine the risk category to which <PRTPAGE P="244"/>the recourse obligation, residual interest or direct credit substitute will be assigned.</FP>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Senior positions not externally rated.</E> For a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest or asset- or mortgage-backed security that is not externally rated but is senior or preferred in all features to a traded position (including collateralization and maturity), a bank may apply a risk weight to the face amount of the senior position in accordance with section 4(d)(1) of this appendix A, based upon the traded position, subject to any current or prospective supervisory guidance and the bank satisfying the OCC that this treatment is appropriate. This section will apply only if the traded position provides substantive credit support to the unrated position until the unrated position matures.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Residual Interests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Concentration limit on credit-enhancing interest-only strips.</E> In addition to the capital requirement provided by section 4(f)(2) of this appendix A, a bank must deduct from Tier 1 capital all credit-enhancing interest-only strips in excess of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital in accordance with section 2(c)(2)(iv) of this appendix A.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Credit-enhancing interest-only strip capital requirement.</E> After applying the concentration limit to credit-enhancing interest-only strips in accordance with section (f)(1), a bank must maintain risk-based capital for a credit-enhancing interest-only strip equal to the remaining amount of the credit-enhancing interest-only strip (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the retention of credit risk associated with a transferred credit-enhancing interest-only strip will be treated as if the credit-enhancing interest-only strip was retained by the bank and not transferred.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Other residual interests capital requirement.</E> Except as provided in sections (d) or (e) of this section, a bank must maintain risk-based capital for a residual interest (excluding a credit-enhancing interest-only strip) equal to the face amount of the residual interest that is retained on the balance sheet (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred.

        <P>(1) <E T="03">Internal risk rating used for asset-backed programs.</E> A direct credit substitute (but not a purchased credit-enhancing interest-only strip) is assumed by a bank in connection with an asset-backed commercial paper program sponsored by the bank and the bank is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC, prior to relying upon its use, that the bank's internal credit risk rating system is adequate. Adequate internal credit risk rating systems usually contain the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) The internal credit risk system is an integral part of the bank's risk management system that explicitly incorporates the full range of risks arising from a bank's participation in securitization activities;</P>

        <P>(ii) Internal credit ratings are linked to measurable outcomes, such as the probability that the position will experience any loss, the position's expected loss given default, and the degree of variance in losses given default on that position;<PRTPAGE P="245"/>
        </P>
        <P>(iii) The bank's internal credit risk system must separately consider the risk associated with the underlying loans or borrowers, and the risk associated with the structure of a particular securitization transaction;</P>
        <P>(iv) The bank's internal credit risk system must identify gradations of risk among “pass” assets and other risk positions;</P>
        <P>(v) The bank must have clear, explicit criteria that are used to classify assets into each internal risk grade, including subjective factors;</P>
        <P>(vi) The bank must have independent credit risk management or loan review personnel assigning or reviewing the credit risk ratings;</P>
        <P>(vii) An internal audit procedure should periodically verify that internal risk ratings are assigned in accordance with the bank's established criteria.</P>
        <P>(viii) The bank must monitor the performance of the internal credit risk ratings assigned to nonrated, nontraded direct credit substitutes over time to determine the appropriateness of the initial credit risk rating assignment and adjust individual credit risk ratings, or the overall internal credit risk ratings system, as needed; and</P>
        <P>(ix) The internal credit risk system must make credit risk rating assumptions that are consistent with, or more conservative than, the credit risk rating assumptions and methodologies of NRSROs.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Program Ratings.</E> A direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not a residual interest) is assumed or retained by a bank in connection with a structured finance program and a NRSRO has reviewed the terms of the program and stated a rating for positions associated with the program. If the program has options for different combinations of assets, standards, internal credit enhancements and other relevant factors, and the NRSRO specifies ranges of rating categories to them, the bank may apply the rating category applicable to the option that corresponds to the bank's position. In order to rely on a program rating, the bank must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating traded positions. The bank must also demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the NRSRO's assignment of ratings for the program are satisfied for the particular position. If a bank participates in a securitization sponsored by another party, the OCC may authorize the bank to use this approach based on a program rating obtained by the sponsor of the program.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Computer Program.</E> The bank is using an acceptable credit assessment computer program to determine the rating of a direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not a residual interest) extended in connection with a structured finance program. A NRSRO must have developed the computer program and the bank must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that ratings under the program correspond credibly and reliably with the rating of traded positions.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations on risk-based capital requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Low-level exposure rule.</E> If the maximum contractual exposure to loss retained or assumed by a bank is less than the effective risk-based capital requirement, as determined in accordance with section 4(b) of this appendix A, for the asset supported by the bank's position, the risk based capital required under this appendix A is limited to the bank's contractual exposure, less any recourse liability account established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This limitation does not apply when a bank provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets that it has sold.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Related on-balance sheet assets.</E> If an asset is included in the calculation of the risk-based capital requirement under this section 4 of this appendix A and also appears as an asset on a bank's balance sheet, the asset is risk-weighted only under this section 4 of this appendix A, except in the case of loan servicing assets and similar arrangements with embedded recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes. In that case, both the on-balance sheet servicing assets and the related recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes must both be separately risk weighted and incorporated into the risk-based capital calculation.</P>

        <P>(2) <E T="03">Capital and reserve requirements.</E> Notwithstanding the risk-based capital treatment outlined in section 2(c)(4) and any other subsection (other than subsection (i)) of this section 4, with respect to a transfer of a small business loan or a lease of personal property with recourse that is a sale under generally accepted accounting principles, a <PRTPAGE P="246"/>qualified bank may elect to apply the following treatment:</P>
        <P>(i) The bank establishes and maintains a non-capital reserve under generally accepted accounting principles sufficient to meet the reasonable estimated liability of the bank under the recourse arrangement; and</P>
        <P>(ii) For purposes of calculating the bank's risk-based capital ratio, the bank includes only the face amount of its recourse in its risk-weighted assets.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Limit on aggregate amount of recourse.</E> The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a qualified bank with respect to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property and included in the risk-weighted assets of the bank as described in section 4(i)(2) of this appendix A may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's total capital after adjustments and deductions, unless the OCC specifies a greater amount by order.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Bank that ceases to be qualified or that exceeds aggregate limit.</E> If a bank ceases to be a qualified bank or exceeds the aggregate limit in section 4(i)(3) of this appendix A, the bank may continue to apply the capital treatment described in section 4(i)(2) of this appendix A to transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property that occurred when the bank was qualified and did not exceed the limit.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Prompt Corrective Action not affected.</E> (i) A bank shall compute its capital without regard to this section 4(i) for purposes of prompt corrective action (12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR part 6) unless the bank is an adequately or well capitalized bank (without applying the capital treatment described in this section 4(i)) and, after applying the capital treatment described in this section 4(i), the bank would be well capitalized.</P>
        <P>(ii) A bank shall compute its capital without regard to this section 4(i) for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o(g) regardless of the bank's capital level.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This appendix establishes risk-based capital requirements for banks with significant exposure to market risk and provides methods for these banks to calculate their risk-based capital requirements for market risk. This appendix supplements and adjusts the risk-based capital calculations under appendix A to this part and appendix C to this part and establishes public disclosure requirements.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This appendix applies to any bank with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the bank's most recent quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report)), equal to:</P>
        <P>(i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly Call Report; or</P>
        <P>(ii) $1 billion or more.</P>
        <P>(2) The OCC may apply this appendix to any bank if the OCC deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the bank or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.</P>
        <P>(3) The OCC may exclude a bank that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this appendix if the OCC determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the bank and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority.</E> (1) The OCC may require a bank to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this appendix if the OCC determines that the bank's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this appendix is not commensurate with the market risk of the bank's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in [12 CFR 3.12, 12 CFR 263.202, 12 CFR 325.6(c), 12 CFR 567.3(d)].</P>
        <P>(2) If the OCC determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this appendix by the bank for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the OCC may require the bank to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.</P>

        <P>(3) The OCC may also require a bank to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this appendix, or under appendix C to this part or appendix A to this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.<PRTPAGE P="248"/>
        </P>
        <P>(4) Nothing in this appendix limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.</P>

        <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for internal models.</E> (1) A bank must obtain the prior written approval of the OCC before using any internal model to calculate its risk-based capital requirement under this appendix.</P>
        <P>(2) A bank must meet all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis. The bank must promptly notify the OCC when:</P>
        <P>(i) The bank plans to extend the use of a model that the OCC has approved under this appendix to an additional business line or product type;</P>
        <P>(ii) The bank makes any change to an internal model approved by the OCC under this appendix that would result in a material change in the bank's risk-weighted asset amount for a portfolio of covered positions; or</P>
        <P>(iii) The bank makes any material change to its modeling assumptions.</P>
        <P>(3) The OCC may rescind its approval of the use of any internal model (in whole or in part) or of the determination of the approach under section 9(a)(2)(ii) of this appendix for a bank's modeled correlation trading positions and determine an appropriate capital requirement for the covered positions to which the model would apply, if the OCC determines that the model no longer complies with this appendix or fails to reflect accurately the risks of the bank's covered positions.</P>
        <P>(4) The bank must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its internal models in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance those models as appropriate to ensure that they continue to meet the OCC's standards for model approval and employ risk measurement methodologies that are most appropriate for the bank's covered positions.</P>
        <P>(5) The bank must incorporate its internal models into its risk management process and integrate the internal models used for calculating its VaR-based measure into its daily risk management process.</P>
        <P>(6) The level of sophistication of a bank's internal models must be commensurate with the complexity and amount of its covered positions. A bank's internal models may use any of the generally accepted approaches, including but not limited to variance-covariance models, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations, to measure market risk.</P>

        <P>(10) If a bank uses internal models to measure specific risk, the internal models must also satisfy the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of section 7 of this appendix.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The bank must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>
        <P>(2) The bank must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The bank's validation process must be independent of the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must include:</P>
        <P>(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the internal models;</P>
        <P>(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and the comparison of the bank's model outputs with relevant internal and external data sources or estimation techniques; and</P>

        <P>(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting. For internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this process must include a comparison of the changes in the bank's portfolio value that <PRTPAGE P="253"/>would have occurred were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with VaR-based measures during a sample period not used in model development.</P>
        <P>(3) The bank must stress test the market risk of its covered positions at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, and in no case less frequently than quarterly. The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the bank's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.</P>
        <P>(4) The bank must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the bank's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the bank's measures for market risk under this appendix. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the bank's board of directors (or a committee thereof).</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Internal assessment of capital adequacy.</E> The bank must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its market risk. The assessment must take into account risks that may not be captured fully in the VaR-based measure, including concentration and liquidity risk under stressed market conditions.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The bank must adequately document all material aspects of its internal models, management and valuation of covered positions, control, oversight, validation and review processes and results, and internal assessment of capital adequacy.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk-based capital ratio denominators.</E> A bank must calculate its general risk-based capital ratio denominator by following the steps described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section. A bank subject to appendix C to this part must use its general risk-based capital ratio denominator for purposes of determining its total risk-based capital ratio and its tier 1 risk-based capital ratio under section 3(a)(2)(ii) and section 3(a)(3)(ii), respectively, of appendix C to this part, provided that the bank may not use the supervisory formula approach (SFA) in section 10(b)(2)(vii)(B) of this appendix for purposes of this calculation. A bank subject to appendix C to this part also must calculate an advanced risk-based capital ratio denominator by following the steps in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section for purposes of determining its total risk-based capital ratio and its tier 1 risk-based capital ratio under sections 3(a)(2)(i) and section 3(a)(3)(i), respectively, of appendix C to this part.</P>

        <P>(ii) For purposes of calculating its general and advanced adjusted risk-weighted assets under paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, respectively, the bank must exclude the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions and over-the-counter derivative positions).</P>
        <P>(iii) For purposes of calculating its general adjusted risk-weighted assets under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a bank may exclude receivables that arise from the posting of cash collateral and are associated with qualifying securities borrowing transactions to the extent the receivable is collateralized by the market value of the borrowed securities.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Measure for market risk.</E> The bank must calculate the general measure for market risk (except, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, that the bank may not use the SFA in section 10(b)(2)(vii)(B) of this appendix for purposes of this calculation), which equals the sum of the VaR-based capital requirement, stressed VaR-based capital requirement, specific risk add-ons, incremental risk capital requirement, comprehensive risk capital requirement, and capital requirement for <E T="03">de minimis</E> exposures all as defined under this paragraph (a)(2). A bank subject to appendix C to this part also must calculate the advanced measure for market risk, which equals the sum of the VaR-based capital requirement, stressed VaR-based capital requirement, specific risk add-ons, incremental risk capital requirement, comprehensive risk capital requirement, and capital requirement for <E T="03">de minimis</E> exposures as defined under this paragraph (a)(2).</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">VaR-based capital requirement.</E> A bank's VaR-based capital requirement equals the greater of:</P>
        <P>(A) The previous day's VaR-based measure as calculated under section 5 of this appendix; or</P>

        <P>(B) The average of the daily VaR-based measures as calculated under section 5 of this appendix for each of the preceding 60 <PRTPAGE P="254"/>business days multiplied by three, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Stressed VaR-based capital requirement.</E> A bank's stressed VaR-based capital requirement equals the greater of:</P>
        <P>(A) The most recent stressed VaR-based measure as calculated under section 6 of this appendix; or</P>
        <P>(B) The average of the stressed VaR-based measures as calculated under section 6 of this appendix for each of the preceding 12 weeks multiplied by three, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Specific risk add-ons.</E> A bank's specific risk add-ons equal any specific risk add-ons that are required under section 7 of this appendix and are calculated in accordance with section 10 of this appendix.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Incremental risk capital requirement.</E> A bank's incremental risk capital requirement equals any incremental risk capital requirement as calculated under section 8 of this appendix.</P>
        <P>(v) <E T="03">Comprehensive risk capital requirement.</E> A bank's comprehensive risk capital requirement equals any comprehensive risk capital requirement as calculated under section 9 of this appendix.</P>
        <P>(vi) <E T="03">Capital requirement for de minimis exposures.</E> A bank's capital requirement for <E T="03">de minimis</E> exposures equals:</P>
        <P>(A) The absolute value of the market value of those <E T="03">de minimis</E> exposures that are not captured in the bank's VaR-based measure or under paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this section; and</P>

The resulting sum is the bank's advanced risk-based capital ratio denominator.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Backtesting.</E> A bank must compare each of its most recent 250 business days' trading losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures calibrated to a one-day holding period and at a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level. A bank must begin backtesting as required by this paragraph no later than one year after the later of January 1, 2013, and the date on which the bank becomes subject to this appendix. In the interim, consistent with safety and soundness principles, a bank subject to this appendix as of its effective date should continue to follow backtesting procedures in accordance with the OCC's supervisory expectations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 5. VaR-Based Measure</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A bank must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the bank's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of section 7 of this appendix. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the bank's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under section 9 of this appendix. A bank may elect to include term repo-style <PRTPAGE P="255"/>transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the bank includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.</P>
        <P>(1) The bank's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve—in no case less than six—to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
        <P>(2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the bank validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the bank must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.</P>
        <P>(3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. A bank with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.</P>
        <P>(4) The bank must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the OCC the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its VaR-based measure that the bank uses in its pricing models.</P>
        <P>(5) The bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the bank's actual positions for which such proxies are used.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure.</E> (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the bank may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. A bank that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the OCC.</P>
        <P>(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the bank's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The bank must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For a bank that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the bank must either:</P>
        <P>(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Demonstrate to the OCC that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the bank's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A bank using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.</P>
        <P>(c) A bank must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the OCC for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the bank and the OCC to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the OCC will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the bank's covered positions. The bank must retain and make available to the OCC the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:</P>
        <P>(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;</P>
        <P>(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and</P>
        <P>(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 6. Stressed VaR-Based Measure</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> At least weekly, a bank must use the same internal model(s) used to calculate its VaR-based measure to calculate a stressed VaR-based measure.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for stressed VaR-based measure.</E> (1) A bank must calculate <PRTPAGE P="256"/>a stressed VaR-based measure for its covered positions using the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR-based measure, subject to the same confidence level and holding period applicable to the VaR-based measure under section 5 of this appendix, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the bank's current portfolio.</P>
        <P>(2) The stressed VaR-based measure must be calculated at least weekly and be no less than the bank's VaR-based measure.</P>
        <P>(3) A bank must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the bank's stressed VaR-based measure under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The bank must obtain the prior approval of the OCC for, and notify the OCC if the bank makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:</P>
        <P>(i) How the bank links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The bank's process for selecting, reviewing, and updating the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and for monitoring the appropriateness of the period to the bank's current portfolio.</P>
        <P>(4) Nothing in this section prevents the OCC from requiring a bank to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the stressed VaR-based measure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 7. Specific Risk</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A bank must use one of the methods in this section to measure the specific risk for each of its debt, equity, and securitization positions with specific risk.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Modeled specific risk.</E> A bank may use models to measure the specific risk of covered positions as provided in paragraph (a) of section 5 of this appendix (therefore, excluding securitization positions that are not modeled under section 9 of this appendix). A bank must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under section 9 of this appendix.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements for specific risk modeling.</E> (i) If a bank uses internal models to measure the specific risk of a portfolio, the internal models must:</P>
        <P>(A) Explain the historical price variation in the portfolio;</P>
        <P>(B) Be responsive to changes in market conditions;</P>
        <P>(C) Be robust to an adverse environment, including signaling rising risk in an adverse environment; and</P>
        <P>(D) Capture all material components of specific risk for the debt and equity positions in the portfolio. Specifically, the internal models must:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Capture event risk and idiosyncratic risk;</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A bank that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under section 7(b) of this appendix using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the bank's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the OCC, a bank may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the bank internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon <PRTPAGE P="257"/>the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. A bank may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for incremental risk modeling.</E> For purposes of calculating the incremental risk measure, the incremental risk model must:</P>
        <P>(1) Measure incremental risk over a one-year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.</P>
        <P>(i) A constant level of risk assumption means that the bank rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions at the beginning of each liquidity horizon over the one-year horizon in a manner that maintains the bank's initial risk level. The bank must determine the frequency of rebalancing in a manner consistent with the liquidity horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a bank to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.</P>
        <P>(ii) A constant position assumption means that the bank maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon. If a bank uses this assumption, it must do so consistently across all portfolios.</P>
        <P>(iii) A bank's selection of a constant position or a constant risk assumption must be consistent between the bank's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 9 of this appendix, if applicable.</P>
        <P>(iv) A bank's treatment of liquidity horizons must be consistent between the bank's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 9 of this appendix, if applicable.</P>
        <P>(2) Recognize the impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors.</P>
        <P>(3) Reflect the effect of issuer and market concentrations, as well as concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed conditions.</P>
        <P>(4) Reflect netting only of long and short positions that reference the same financial instrument.</P>
        <P>(5) Reflect any material mismatch between a position and its hedge.</P>
        <P>(6) Recognize the effect that liquidity horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. In such cases, a bank must:</P>
        <P>(i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>
        <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</P>
        <P>(iii) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</P>
        <P>(iv) Capture in the incremental risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies.</P>
        <P>(7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behavior with respect to default and migration changes.</P>
        <P>(8) Maintain consistency with the bank's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing risk.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of incremental risk capital requirement.</E> The incremental risk capital requirement is the greater of:</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> (1) Subject to the prior approval of the OCC, a bank may use the method in this section to measure comprehensive risk, that is, all price risk, for one or more portfolios of correlation trading positions.</P>
        <P>(2) A bank that measures the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions using internal models must calculate at least weekly a comprehensive risk measure that captures all price risk according to the requirements of this section. The comprehensive risk measure is either:</P>
        <P>(i) The sum of:</P>
        <P>(A) The bank's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(B) A surcharge for the bank's modeled correlation trading positions equal to the total specific risk add-on for such positions as calculated under section 10 of this appendix multiplied by 8.0 percent; or</P>
        <P>(ii) With approval of the OCC and provided the bank has met the requirements of this section for a period of at least one year and can demonstrate the effectiveness of the model through the results of ongoing model validation efforts including robust benchmarking, the greater of:</P>
        <P>(A) The bank's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(B) The total specific risk add-on that would apply to the bank's modeled correlation trading positions as calculated under section 10 of this appendix multiplied by 8.0 percent.</P>

        <P>(2) The model must capture all material price risk, including but not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The risks associated with the contractual structure of cash flows of the position, its issuer, and its underlying exposures;</P>
        <P>(ii) Credit spread risk, including nonlinear price risks;</P>
        <P>(iii) The volatility of implied correlations, including nonlinear price risks such as the cross-effect between spreads and correlations;</P>
        <P>(iv) Basis risk;</P>
        <P>(v) Recovery rate volatility as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; and</P>
        <P>(vi) To the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates the benefits of dynamic hedging, the static nature of the hedge over the liquidity horizon must be recognized. In such cases, a bank must:</P>
        <P>(A) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>
        <P>(B) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</P>
        <P>(C) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</P>
        <P>(D) Capture in the comprehensive risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies;</P>
        <P>(3) The bank must use market data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the bank's correlation trading positions in order to ensure that the bank fully captures the material risks of the correlation trading positions in its comprehensive risk measure in accordance with this section; and</P>
        <P>(4) The bank must be able to demonstrate that its model is an appropriate representation of comprehensive risk in light of the historical price variation of its correlation trading positions.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for stress testing.</E> (1) A bank must at least weekly apply specific, supervisory stress scenarios to its portfolio of correlation trading positions that capture changes in:</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 10. Standardized Measurement Method for Specific Risk</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A bank must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the bank's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under section 9 of this appendix. A bank must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in this appendix, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this section 10.</P>
        <P>(1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current market value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.</P>

        <P>(2) For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, a bank must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the market value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the bank directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, a bank must risk weight the market value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.<PRTPAGE P="259"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, a bank may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. A bank may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the bank includes the costs of conversion.</P>
        <P>(4) A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:</P>
        <P>(i) The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in market value of the debt or securitization position);</P>
        <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;</P>
        <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and</P>
        <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.</P>
        <P>(5) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:</P>
        <P>(i) The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;</P>
        <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;</P>
        <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position; and</P>
        <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in the case where the credit derivative hedge has a standard maturity date:</P>
        <P>(A) The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or</P>
        <P>(B) For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.</P>
        <P>(6) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Debt and securitization positions.</E> (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, a bank must multiply the absolute value of the current market value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) For the purpose of this section, the appropriate specific risk-weighting factors include:</P>

        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A bank that uses appendix C to this part must calculate a specific risk add-on for a securitization position using the SFA in section 45 of appendix C to this part and in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section if the bank and the securitization position each qualifies to use the SFA under appendix C to this part. A bank that uses appendix C to this part and that has a securitization position that does not qualify for the SFA may assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the securitization position using the SSFA in accordance with section 11 of this appendix or assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A bank must treat a short securitization position as if it is a long securitization position solely for calculation purposes when using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) or the SSFA in section 11 of this appendix.</P>

        <P>(C) <E T="03">SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a bank must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with section 11 of this appendix.</P>

A bank must determine its position in the nth-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional dollar amount of all the underlying exposures.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For purposes of determining the specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) or the specific risk-weighting factor for an nth-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA in section 11 of this appendix, the bank must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its position as follows:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the bank's position to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the specific add-on for its position in an nth-to-default credit derivative, parameter A must be set equal to <E T="03">the credit enhancement level</E> (L) input to the SFA formula. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the bank's position. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default <PRTPAGE P="263"/>credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the bank's position.</P>

For purposes of using the SFA to calculate the specific risk add-on for its position in an nth-to-default credit derivative, parameter D must be set to equal L plus the <E T="03">thickness of tranche</E> (T) input to the SFA formula.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A bank that does not use the SFA to determine a specific risk-add on, or the SSFA to determine a specific risk-weighting factor for its position in an nth-to-default credit derivative must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Modeled correlation trading positions.</E> For purposes of calculating the comprehensive risk measure for modeled correlation trading positions under either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of section 9 of this appendix, the total specific risk add-on is the greater of:</P>

        <P>(1) The bank must multiply the absolute value of the current market value of each net long or net short equity position by a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent.

        <P>(ii) Long and short positions in index contracts at the same date in different, but similar indices.</P>
        <P>(3) For futures contracts on main indices that are matched by offsetting positions in a basket of stocks comprising the index, a bank may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to the futures and stock basket positions (long and short), provided that such trades are deliberately entered into and separately controlled, and that the basket of stocks is comprised of stocks representing at least 90.0 percent of the capitalization of the index. A main index refers to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, the FTSE All-World Index, and any other index for which the bank can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that the equities represented in the index have liquidity, depth of market, and size of bid-ask spreads comparable to equities in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and FTSE All-World Index.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Due diligence requirements.</E> (1) A bank must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization position that would materially affect the performance of the position by conducting and documenting the analysis set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

        <P>(2) To support the demonstration of its comprehensive understanding, for each securitization position a bank must:</P>
        <P>(i) Conduct an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization position prior to acquiring the position and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring the position, considering:</P>

        <P>(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the position, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, the performance of organizations that <PRTPAGE P="264"/>service the position, and deal-specific definitions of default;</P>
        <P>(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</P>
        <P>(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, most recent sales price and historical price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</P>
        <P>(D) For resecuritization positions, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 11. Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach</HD>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a bank must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data and no more than 91 calendar days old. A bank that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described and defined, for purposes of this section, in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a bank must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section:</P>
        <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using appendix A to this part. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and 1 (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to .08).</P>
        <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures within the securitized pool that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph (b)(2) to the ending balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
        <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
        <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
        <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
        <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
        <P>(v) Has contractually deferred interest payments for 90 days or more; or</P>
        <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>
        <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the bank to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the bank's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

        <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
        <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying pool of exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.</P>

        <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.</P>

        <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization position is greater <PRTPAGE P="265"/>than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the bank must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average of 1.00 and K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, but with the parameter A revised to be set equal to K<E T="52">A</E>.

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> A bank must comply with this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a depository institution that is subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. A bank must make quantitative disclosures publicly each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the bank's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a bank believes that disclosure of <PRTPAGE P="266"/>specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the bank is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure policy.</E> The bank must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses the bank's approach for determining its market risk disclosures.
